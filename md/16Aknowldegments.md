# Acknowledgements

There have been so many wonderful people who have helped us to bring this collection to life. The brilliant authors for not only contributing their time but for generously diving into the experimental “collective review” process. To Geert Lovink for his patience and support of our project, and for his commitment and vision to modes of publication that subvert the constraining norms of academic practice. To the editors and reviewers at *Science as Culture*, in particular Kean Birch and Kelly Bronson who edited its ‘Forum on Big Tech’ where we initially published on the ‘economy of virtue.’ To Elena Gomez for her swift and incisive editing. To the presenters who joined us at our first Economies of Virtue workshop in July 2021: Angela Daly, Sarah Pink, Brett Neilson, Mark Andrejevic, Julia Powles, Sy Taffel, Winifred Poster, Tsvetelina Hristova, Michael Richardson, Tanja Dreher, and Ed Santow. To Emma Kowal for her support and guidance in helping us to apply for the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia workshop program grant. And finally, to the many interlocutors who have generously held conversations with us and more as we explored this thorny topic, especially Seth Lazar, Kate Devitt, Christine Parker, and Julia Powles.
