# Ecocide isn’t Ethical: Political Ecology and Capitalist AI Ethics

### Sy Taffel, Laura Bedford, and Monique Mann

## Introduction

Emerging discourses surrounding new forms of extractivism associated
with data and digital technologies are framed as ‘the new oil’;[^09Taffel_1] as
the key raw material that drives the information economy;[^09Taffel_2] as a new
form of circulatory capital;[^09Taffel_3] or as a new type of colonialism.[^09Taffel_4]
While the framing varies, these conceptualizations of digital
technoculture illuminate numerous harms that amplify existing social
inequalities,[^09Taffel_5] discriminate against certain groups of people[^09Taffel_6] and
enact predictive logics of control.[^09Taffel_7] However, these ‘new’ forms of
data-driven extractivism are not distinct from ‘old’ forms of
extractivism associated with procuring the materials and energy required
for digital technologies and infrastructures, or the social and
environmental impacts associated with the enormous increases in
production, consumption and waste which results from data processing,
storage, and transmission in the 21st century.

Responses to harms associated with computational systems are often
framed within the field of ‘AI ethics,’[^09Taffel_8] where a focus on enhancing
privacy, or making AI more ‘fair,’ ‘accountable,’ and ‘transparent’,
elides larger ethical questions relating to the significant harms to
both present and future ecosystems associated with the energy, labour,
and materials required for the production, maintenance, use, and waste
disposal associated with AI. The planetary assemblages of code, carbon,
cobalt, copper, and numerous other materials that compose contemporary
AI plays a significant role in climate change and associated ecological
crises of the Capitalocene.[^09Taffel_9] Given the Paris Agreement targets to
limit global heating to under 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
levels, and preferably to no more than 1.5 degrees,[^09Taffel_10] any meaningful
discussion of AI ethics must address a much broader set of concerns than
it presently does. This includes acknowedging AI’s contribution to the
impacts of climate change including drought, biodiversity loss,
flooding, extinctions, coastal submergence, and issues of food and water
security, among many other material consequences. Omitting to address
these harms when considering AI, we argue, is *unethical.* In this
chapter we draw from the field of political ecology to explore what
kinds of systemic and structural changes are needed for AI to be
considered ‘ethical’?

We argue that the ecocidal tendencies of current global economic
arrangements, where digital technologies and AI are positioned as key
drivers of economic growth (*and* the solution to the climate crisis
itself,[^09Taffel_11] requires a reframing of the ethics of AI. Technology cannot
be understood as being neutral in taking us to this point of global
ecological crisis and, further, its role will not be neutral as we
address the crisis. It is critical, therefore, that we centre the *role
of technology* in our prefiguration of future global arrangements. While
political ecology focuses on making explicit the political, social, and
economic dimensions of environmental crises that are often aberrantly
perceived as being ‘natural’ and ‘apolitical,’ we draw on a growing body
of literature which has centred this conceptual lens towards
technology,[^09Taffel_12] data,[^09Taffel_13] the digital economy,[^09Taffel_14] and e-waste.[^09Taffel_15]

These recent works apply the framework of political ecology to
demonstrate how the ecological and political-economic dimensions of
digital technologies that are typically misidentified as being
‘dematerialized’ or ‘artificial.’ Both these terms effectively conceal
the material dimensions of these artefacts, contributing to their
frequent portrayal as apolitical, neutral, mathematical objects.
Although ecology and technology are situated very differently with
regards to an imagined nature/culture dualism, they share a tendency to
be positioned as politically neutral issues that should be addressed by
differing branches of the sciences rather than being understood as
entangled with systems of power. This focus on power, inequalities,
politics, and collective action is underpinned by political ecology’s
view of ethics as normatively being concerned with social action that
redistributes power towards subaltern groups,[^09Taffel_16] aligning the approach
of political ecology with emerging arguments that discourse surrounding
AI should ‘transcend the language of “ethics” and engage with power and
political economy.’[^09Taffel_17] A key point here is that ‘AI ethics’ frequently
becomes a way for powerful corporations to avoid regulation by adopting
voluntary practices focused on technical fixes that fail to meaningfully
address harms associated with AI.

While there has been some scholarly work to broaden AI ethics to include
AI’s ecological impacts,[^09Taffel_18] these contributions have tended to be
limited to narrow technical considerations. As such, we begin by
contrasting a political ecology approach that centers ecological harms
and inequitable power relations, with the discourse of ‘green AI’[^09Taffel_19]
that focuses concern on the carbon costs of training ML models. While
the ecology of AI includes the data centers where ML training and
inference occurs, we argue that the impacts go far beyond data centers,
situating those facilities within flows of energy, labour, knowledge,
and the myriad materials necessary for AI systems to operate.
Nonetheless, we begin our examination of the ecopolitical impacts of AI
with data centres, as this has been both the central focus of the
sustainable AI literature and a key site within critical studies of
digital infrastructures.[^09Taffel_20]

Subsequently, we critique two prominent, interconnected discourses that
suggest digital technologies enable the maintenance of the socioeconomic
status quo in the face of ecological crises. The first discourse argues
that AI facilitates a hyper-efficient mode of production that decouples
the production of wealth from material constraints, allowing the
continuation of economic business as usual. We demonstrate how this line
of reasoning does not hold up to scrutiny when viewed through the lens
of political ecology. The second discourse we critique is premised on
the erroneous contention that technological innovation will
straightforwardly solve contemporary ecological crises. We challenge
techno-solutionist responses which recast a crisis of capitalism as a
business opportunity for innovative tech corporations. Instead, we argue
that the hegemonic discourse related to AI ethics legitimates ecocide
while actively inhibiting the systemic and structural social, political,
and cultural transformations that are required. This includes, for
example recognizing ecocide in national international criminal law.[^09Taffel_21]

We conclude by briefly outlining alternatives to hyper-efficient green
growth and technological solutionism. We acknowledge that substantial
debates exist within political ecology scholarship relating to the
possible world we should strive for and how to get there. These debates
extend to the role envisaged to be played by technology in both the
transition and in the society being prefigured. These positions include
degrowth, ecosocialism, conviviality, commoning, and public service
models of digital infrastructure. It is beyond the scope of this short
chapter to engage with all these perspectives in any depth.
Nevertheless, highlighting these alternatives outlines postcapitalist
pathways towards more ethical forms of AI. Emphasizing the structural
causes of ecological harms associated with existing economic practices
foregrounds how debates surrounding AI ethics function to legitimize and
normalize AI’s contributions to systemic ecocide rather than
meaningfully challenge them. Consequently, employing the lens of
political ecology, we add our voices to accounts which critique AI
ethics as ethics-washing and/or greenwashing, instead contending that
the focus needs to shift towards structural issues of power.[^09Taffel_22]

##  (not-so) Green AI

AI is resource-intensive in ways that are often overlooked. Recent
debates surrounding AI, ethics and sustainability have largely focused
on the carbon cost of training ML models.[^09Taffel_23] This partly results from
a prominent paper which estimated that a single training run of a
specific ML model emits 284,019 kg of CO2e.[^09Taffel_24] Although this estimate
is staggeringly high, equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 3,422
iPhone 13s,[^09Taffel_25] it received little prominence in the original paper,
which acknowledged that alternative hardware could reduce training time
by a factor of 8.5, signaling the estimate had a substantial margin of
error.[^09Taffel_26] Indeed, subsequent research argues that erroneous
assumptions, such as using the ‘big’ 213 million parameter Transformer
model for the experiment rather than the 65 million parameter base
model, entailed that the training run would have resulted in 15,200 kg
CO2e in an average US data centre, or 3,200 kg CO2e using the hardware
in Google’s Georgia data centre where the real-world model ran.[^09Taffel_27]

In fact, however, more pertinent to the ecological impacts of ML systems
was Strubell et al.’s finding that another model, whose development they
followed from inception to deployment as a case study, required *4789
training runs*, equivalent to ‘60 GPU’s \[graphics processing units\]
running constantly throughout the six-month duration of the
project,’[^09Taffel_28] highlighting the fallacy of focusing on the CO2 emissions
of single training runs. Furthermore, far more energy is used running ML
systems (what is known as inference) than training models. Nvidia
estimate 80 to 90 percent of the cost of machine learning systems is
inference rather than the initial training,[^09Taffel_29] while Amazon Web
Services state that inference accounts for up to 90 percent of the cost
of machine learning.[^09Taffel_30]

The data centers where high-performance computers are used in parallel
to conduct training and inference for ML systems (alongside activities
including data storage, web hosting, and video transcoding) are, of
course, one area of intense energy and resource use. Estimates for
global energy use within data centers vary widely, from 205
terawatt-hours (TWh)[^09Taffel_31] to 400-500 TWh.[^09Taffel_32] This equates to between
one and two percent of all global electricity use. Forecast increases in
data storage and processing, ML dataset size, training, inference, and
other computationally intensive tasks such as transcoding and streaming
8K video, mean that data centre energy use is estimated to rise to
approximately 780 TWh by 2030.[^09Taffel_33]

The past decade has seen a significant centralisation of data
accompanied towards large cloud and hyperscale data centres. By 2021
there were 659 hyperscale data centres[^09Taffel_34] (Synergy Research Group,
2021), a figure which has more than doubled since 2015.[^09Taffel_35] Half of
these are owned and operated by just three companies, Amazon, Microsoft,
and Google.[^09Taffel_36] Whereas historically, many businesses ran small,
in-house centers, hyperscale data centres exemplify the logic of
platform capitalism,[^09Taffel_37] insofar as they leverage economies of scale
and network effects that centralise facilities, with a few oligopolistic
technology companies leasing space and compute to smaller businesses.
One purported benefit of hyperscale data centres is an increase in
energy efficiency,[^09Taffel_38] a point we return to in the following section
where we discuss efficiency and decoupling.

While carbon costs are important, the narrow focus of these studies
masks the urgent necessity of meaningfully considering the ecological
impacts of AI/ML that go far beyond the energy use associated with
powering particular training models or inference within data centres.
Instead, it requires analyzing the material and energy flows associated
with the *entire* supply chain and assemblage of software, hardware and
infrastructure required for ML systems to function. Political ecology
here provides a useful alternative to existing ‘green’ and ‘ethical’ AI,
both because of its focus on mapping the material and energy footprints
of sociotechnical systems from cradle to grave, and its emphasis on
ecological systems being thoroughly entangled with and affected by
power, inequality and violence. Data centers also require enormous
amounts of water.[^09Taffel_39] Within data centers, vast amounts of heat are
generated, requiring active cooling.[^09Taffel_40] Water is central to the
cooling process, with chilled water employed as a heat transfer
mechanism to reduce air temperatures.[^09Taffel_41] In 2014, U.S.-based data
centers used approximately 626 billion litres of water.[^09Taffel_42] While data
center water consumption (1.7 billion litres/day) is a small fraction of
total water consumption (1218 billion liters/day)[^09Taffel_43] acute and
significant impacts of data centers on water availability are dependent
on geographical location. For example, data centers in the western and
south-western U.S. depend upon already scarce and stressed
watersheds,[^09Taffel_44] placing technology corporations in conflict with local
communities and ecosystems. When ecological disasters occur, technology
corporations are often prioritised over local people.[^09Taffel_45]

While ‘green AI’ approaches[^09Taffel_46] focus on reducing the electricity
needed to train and run models within data centers, they rarely engage
with the human and environmental costs associated with producing or
disposing of hardware or the infrastructure that houses and cools that
technology. These social and environmental harms include those
associated with industries that extract conflict minerals like tantalum,
tungsten, and gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),[^09Taffel_47] or
where extraction is dependent on child labour such as cobalt from the
DRC.[^09Taffel_48] Unbridled extraction of other materials such as lanthanides
(commonly known as rare earth minerals) leave a toxic legacy of
localised environmental and human health impacts such as producing
‘cancer villages’ in China.[^09Taffel_49]

Further to this, none of these materials come out of the ground ready
for use in high-performance computing. Another set of energy-intensive
extraction processes separates and purifies raw materials, resulting in
significant levels of additional pollution. Processes of beneficiation
remove most of the raw material that was extracted from the earth. In
the case of copper, for example, as high-grade ores are increasingly
depleted, the concentration within commercially viable ores has fallen
from 2 percent to 0.8 percent,[^09Taffel_50] meaning that over 99 percent of the
mass of extracted material is waste/tailings.[^09Taffel_51] The processes
employed for purification require significant energy inputs and often
require the use of toxic materials. For example, the silicon used in
CPUs, GPUs and TPUs requires several stages of chemical processing to
reach 99.999999999 percent purity,[^09Taffel_52] before it undergoes processes of
thermal oxidation, photolithography, plasma etching and doping, all of
which are chemically and energetically intensive, requiring precise
controls over substances and temperatures, some of which reach
1100°C.[^09Taffel_53]

The matter and energy required for AI largely flow from the global
economic periphery towards the burgeoning technomass in the economic
core.[^09Taffel_54] Contemporaneously, theories of data colonialism outline the
flow of financial value and data from the economic periphery towards the
core.[^09Taffel_55] This ecologically unequal exchange (EUE),[^09Taffel_56] is not
incidental to, but comprises instead a constitutive element of global
capitalism which has persisted throughout past and present forms of
colonialism and imperialism.[^09Taffel_57] Under conditions of EUE, raw materials
and energy flow from periphery to core, while the periphery also
functions as a ‘dump’ for much of the 50 million tons of toxic e-waste
generated annually.[^09Taffel_58] Recent research in ecological economics
indicates that high income countries’ usage of raw material exceeds
domestic extraction by over 10 billion tons, while all regions except
high-income countries are net providers of raw materials.[^09Taffel_59]As we have
demonstrated, this includes the raw materials required for AI.

While hardware located inside data centres is necessary for ML systems,
a holistic and ethical appraisal should also include all the network and
platform infrastructure that connects data centres to end-client
devices. This includes undersea and terrestrial fibre-optic cables,
internet exchange points and cable landing stations and many of the
desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone and IoT devices that engage with ML
systems. Furthermore, ML systems require training data, for example, the
ImageNet dataset that has been commonly used for image recognition were
drawn from Flickr,[^09Taffel_60] so the assemblage required for ML systems
employing these datasets includes Flickr’s platform infrastructure and
the array of digital cameras, smartphones and computers that created the
dataset. The images were labelled by humans sourced through Amazon
Mechanical Turk—which pays workers well below minimum wage while failing
to offer the protections associated with employment.[^09Taffel_61] The
exploitative and precarious human labour associated with such systems
should also be recognised as a component of the ecology of an ML system.

Mapping the scale of the system required for contemporary ML goes far
beyond a server in a data center and the energy it requires and the
emissions it produces. It includes a vast array of devices, operations,
facilities, and people located across the planet. Each device is itself
an assemblage of materials whose extraction, processing and disposal are
associated with a range of environmental, social, and labour justice
issues, which remain neglected in most contemporary conceptions of
‘ethical AI.’ Acknowledging the scale of this assemblage and the range
and severity of harms it inflicts on people and ecosystems unmasks any
notion that AI under current extractivist capitalism arrangements of EUE
is ethical, or that it could be regarded as ethical if only privacy
concerns were addressed, biases were removed from training datasets so
they are ‘fairer,’ or the models themselves were more ‘transparent’ and
‘accountable.’ Indeed, the current, extremely narrow framing of AI
ethics largely serves to benefit technology corporations who enact minor
technical modifications to ecologically calamitous technologies whilst
boldly pronouncing that this proves they are acting ethically.

## Efficiency, Technology, and Capitalism

The myopic focus on the energy costs of training models results in
‘solutions’ based on improving efficiency, reducing carbon costs by
limiting the computational intensity or training dataset size of machine
learning models.[^09Taffel_62] These ‘solutions’ miss broader points around ML
systems, supply chains and infrastructure; solely focusing on energy use
within data centers fails to consider the upstream and downstream costs
and externalities, or recognize the historical and ongoing relationships
between technology, efficiency, and capitalism.

‘Green AI’[^09Taffel_63] advocates that increasing energy efficiency enables a
decoupling of economic growth and environmental impacts, therefore
reducing ecological harms from ML. Assessing this claim requires some
context surrounding decoupling, technology and ‘green growth.’ Since the
industrial revolution there have been strong positive correlations
between economic growth (measured in GDP) and both greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and material footprints (i.e., the overall mass of materials
used by a society).[^09Taffel_64] The goal of decoupling is to allow economic
growth to continue unabated while decreasing presently associated
ecological harms. Here several key distinctions surrounding the form,
scale, and rate of decoupling are required. The first distinction is
between relative decoupling—which means that while rates of growth and
GHG/material footprints diverge, there remain overall increases of
resource use/harms—and absolute decoupling, where economic growth
increases while GHG/material footprints decrease. A second important
distinction involves the geographical scale of analysis. While there are
numerous exemplars of OECD nations achieving absolute decoupling at a
national level,[^09Taffel_65] that decoupling has been achieved through
offshoring industry and importing goods and materials, i.e., a form of
regional decoupling predicated upon EUE. To avert ecological
catastrophe, absolute decoupling must take place on a global rather than
national or regional scale. Finally, for green growth to be ethical
*and* sustainable, the absolute decoupling of economic growth from GHG
emissions must be sufficiently rapid to meet (or indeed exceed) global
environmental commitments such as the Paris Agreement.

Assuming continued economic growth of around 2 percent a year, this
decoupling would require OECD nations to reduce emissions at a rate of
15 percent per annum until they reach zero.[^09Taffel_66] While moving from
fossil fuels to renewable energy does decouple GHG emissions from energy
use, there is no empirical evidence to support this rate of absolute
decoupling of GHG emissions from economic growth. Additionally, since
1990 global growth in material use has *outpaced* growth in GDP.[^09Taffel_67]
There is no contemporary evidence for any trend towards decoupling of
economic growth and resource use; in fact for every unit of economic
growth over this time, *more* resources have been required. While the
current global material footprint is approaching 100 billion tons per
annum—having more than doubled since 1990—a sustainable level is
estimated to be 25–50 billion tons per annum.[^09Taffel_68] Further, the vast
majority of material footprint growth since 1990—81 percent at a per
capita level—is attributable to high income nations, further
demonstrating that the responsibility for current ecological crises is
deeply inequitable.[^09Taffel_69]

Moving from global aggregate figures to focus on efficiency and AI,
digital technology has long involved a relative decoupling between
metrics of performance and energy use.[^09Taffel_70] Exemplifying these changes,
data centres have become more energy efficient over time, particularly
with the move towards hyperscale and cloud data centres.[^09Taffel_71] The metric
for measuring data center energy efficiency is power use effectiveness
(PUE), a ratio demarcating the proportion of a data centers’ energy use
required for operating the IT equipment in comparison with the total
energy required by the facility (which includes energy for cooling,
lighting, etc.). An ideal PUE would be 1, signaling that total energy
usage equals that used by the IT equipment. As of 2020, the US average
PUE was 1.59, while certain data centers have achieved a ratio of
1.11.[^09Taffel_72] However, PUE only measures efficiency, not the overall energy
use of the facility,[^09Taffel_73] or the total number of facilities.
Accordingly, while facilities become more efficient, total data center
energy use has grown.[^09Taffel_74]

Efficiency gains are essential in shoring up capitalist economic growth
and have been present throughout the history of computational
development.[^09Taffel_75] The problem is that efficiency gains are typically
negated by rebound effects such as Jevons’s paradox:[^09Taffel_76] more
efficiently using resources leads to overall increases in resource use.
Nonetheless, it is in the economic interests of data centre owners to
increase efficiency, which reduces costs, therefore enhancing profits.
This is not to suggest that efficiency is ‘bad’, but within a
growth-based capitalist economy, efficiency savings do not typically
lead to absolute reductions of emissions or materials usage—they
increase material input overall. As Foster and colleagues argue, ‘An
economic system devoted to profits, accumulation, and economic expansion
without end will tend to use any efficiency gains or cost reductions to
expand the overall scale of production.’[^09Taffel_77] What is required, then, is
a shift away from the conflation of exchange value (i.e., GDP) with
social progress and abandoning the fairy-tale of endless economic
growth. Our conclusion outlines strategies for achieving this, but we
first turn to a second model for resolving ecological crises under
‘green capitalism’ via technological solutionism.[^09Taffel_78]

## The Fallacy of Technological Solutionism

New and emerging technologies are positioned as a panacea to ecological
crises, enabling current forms of overconsumption to continue unabated.
This is exemplified by former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s
statement that we will resolve climate change through ‘technology not
taxes.’[^09Taffel_79] This approach is far from novel. In 2007, six years after
withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated industrialized
nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then U.S. President George
W. Bush and then Australian prime minister John Howard released a joint
statement arguing that ‘the development and deployment of low emission
technologies will be a key element in addressing the climate
challenge,’[^09Taffel_80] citing clean coal and carbon capture and storage (CCS)
as technological solutions. Fifteen years on, clean coal and CCS have
repeatedly failed to demonstrate technical and economic viability.[^09Taffel_81]
As Kuch illustrates, CCS is framed by a worldview derived from the
fossil fuel industries, for whom climate change is a technical issue to
resolve technologically rather than by phasing out fossil fuels.[^09Taffel_82]

While at first glance, CCS appears to be a sleight of hand employed by
the fossil fuel industries and right-wing political leaders to inhibit
actions that address ecological crises, it has been embraced by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report,[^09Taffel_83]
which centers CCS in conjunction with bioenergy (abbreviated to BECCS)
in socio-economic models designed to avert catastrophic climate change.
BECCS features in over 100 of the 116 scenarios for avoiding dangerous
warming.[^09Taffel_84] BECCS theoretically allows significant overshoot of the
carbon budget for remaining under 2°C of warming as it produces negative
emissions, capturing carbon dioxide from the air in trees, turning these
trees into pellets that are then burnt, and capturing the carbon
emissions and storing them underground, thereby reducing atmospheric CO2
levels. Relying on problematic (and probably inaccurate) forecasts for
significant negative emissions in the second half of the 21st-century
allows governments to delay reducing emissions now based on a
speculative panacea of unrealized future technological innovations.[^09Taffel_85]
While CCS technology has so far failed to realize efficacy claims, the
bioenergy component of BECCS is also problematic, with the land required
for biomass in IPCC models typically being one to two times the size of
India.[^09Taffel_86] In conjunction with the reduction of crop yields in a
warming world, this likely compounds the catastrophic food shortages and
reductions in biodiversity already being experienced in parts of the
global economic periphery.[^09Taffel_87]

The issue is not just that technological solutionism (such as BECCS) is
unlikely to resolve ecological crises, but also that they are a
distraction that actively inhibits the collective social, political, and
cultural change that is urgently required by suggesting that technology
(including technologies that do not yet exist) will comprehensively
‘fix’ the ecological crises, so there is little to be gained by citizens
demanding action now.[^09Taffel_88] In the case of AI, the alleged solutionist
silver bullet involves using renewable energy to power data centres. Big
Tech companies have embraced this extremely limited definition of
sustainability, foregrounding it within promotional materials such as
annual environmental reports that publicly portray themselves as leading
society towards a sustainable future.[^09Taffel_89]

For example, Google’s 2020 environmental report declares ‘sustainability
is one of our core values at Google and we’ve been a leader on climate
change since the company’s founding over 20 years ago.’[^09Taffel_90] Google
claims that they became the first major company to become carbon neutral
in 2007 and that by 2020 they had ‘neutralized our legacy carbon
footprint since our founding, making Google the first major company to
be carbon neutral for its entire operating history.’ However, the
environmental data located at the end of Google’s environmental report
shows otherwise. Unpacking this data requires a basic grasp of the ways
corporations measure and audit emissions. Distinctions are drawn between
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions;[^09Taffel_91] Scope 1 refers to emissions produced by
directly owned sources, such as onsite furnaces, while Scope 2 covers
the GHG emissions associated with purchased electricity and other
utilities. Scope 3 emissions are usually the most significant in terms
of overall volume, they include all the emissions associated with those
that the company is indirectly responsible for, all the way up and down
its supply chain.

Whereas Google’s total reported emissions for 2019 were 17,646,902
tCO2e—the majority of which are Scope 3 emissions, whose sources are of
indeterminate origin within the document, but which almost certainly
arise from the production of hardware and infrastructure[^09Taffel_92]—Google’s
emissions reductions arising from onsite renewable installations, power
purchase agreements with third-party providers and carbon offset
projects totalled 5,725,635 tCO2e.[^09Taffel_93] Basic arithmetic demonstrates
that net emissions far exceed mitigation, Google was not carbon neutral
in 2019, let alone counteracting the corporation’s historical carbon
footprint as the Environmental Report claims. Google’s declaration of
carbon neutrality only includes their negligible direct emissions and
more substantial electricity usage (Scope 1 and 2 emissions), and simply
ignore the vast carbon footprint associated with producing hardware and
infrastructure. Ergo Google’s claims surrounding carbon neutrality are a
straightforward case of greenwashing through a strategy of selective
disclosure,[^09Taffel_94] whereby a company selectively highlights positive
elements of their environmental performance in order to misleadingly
portray themselves.

In comparison to Google, Apple deserves praise for including their
supply chain (Scope 3 emissions) within their carbon footprint, and for
moving to make their entire business carbon neutral within a decade.
However, despite first appearances, Apple still falls short of genuinely
sustainable action. Between 2016 and 2020 electricity use at Apple’s
corporate facilities (primarily data centers) almost doubled, rising
from 1,420,000 MWh to 2,580,000 MWh.[^09Taffel_95] Although during this period
Apple increased renewable electricity usage to cover this increase,
there are two reasons why this cannot reasonably be considered
sustainable. Firstly, in the USA, where approximately 80 percent of
Apple’s corporate electricity usage occurs, over 60 percent of
electricity generation was from fossil fuels in 2021.[^09Taffel_96] While
decarbonization urgently requires replacing fossil fuels with renewable
energy, in Apple’s case, instead of replacing existing fossil fuel
generation, vast amounts of renewable energy are required to cover the
rapid growth in electricity usage associated with data centres.[^09Taffel_97]

The history of energy is often narrativized as the successive dominance
of coal, then oil, then gas. What this periodization obscures is the
fact that these sources have supplemented, rather than replaced, one
another. Since the first IPCC report in 1990, coal use has increased
slightly, oil and gas use has nearly doubled, and by 2019 solar and wind
combined provided just 2.6 percent of global energy.[^09Taffel_98] Transitioning
away from fossil fuels within the time required to avoid global warming
above 2 degrees is a monumental task, one that means the additive logic
of the energy mix since the industrial revolution must be supplanted by
one whereby the energy currently provided by fossil fuels is rapidly
replaced by renewables. In this context, alongside the need for growth
in energy use among non-OECD nations in the global periphery and
semi-periphery where electricity blackouts are common and billions lack
internet access, rapid growth in electricity demand within affluent
nations in the economic core cannot be considered just nor ‘ethical.’

The second issue is that alongside GHG emissions, material footprint is
a pressing ecological issue and solar panels and wind turbines require
many of the materials also required for digital hardware such as
highly-purified silicon, rare earth minerals, lithium, and cobalt.
Accepting the finitude of these resources, and the inequitably
experienced social and environmental harms associated with their
extraction, entails realizing that while energy sources such as the sun
and the wind are renewable, the technological means of converting them
into electricity is not. Solutionists contend that further speculative
technologies, such as deep-sea[^09Taffel_99] or comet mining[^09Taffel_100] will resolve
the scarcity of terrestrial materials required for green capitalism.
However, given both the multi-decadal timescales involved and the fact
that ventures such as deep-sea mining will cause significant
environmental harms, these claims should not distract us from the urgent
task of reducing emissions, material usage and ultimately consumption.

Far from genuinely resolving problems, technological solutionism
provides an extremely narrow focus that ignores the broader context of
EUE and serves, instead to greenwash corporate communications. The
neoliberal technical fix is designed to preserve existing systems of
power and privilege by positing technical fixes that maintain a
growth-orientated capitalist model which is fundamentally unethical and
at odds with ecological justice.

## Conclusion

This chapter forms a damning critique that ‘ethical’ and ‘green’ AI can
render current AI systems ethical and just, especially where ethical
interventions are largely limited to mathematically addressable
technical fixes to make AI systems more ‘fair’, ‘accountable’ and
‘transparent.’[^09Taffel_101] Instead, we must take action to remedy ecological
harms associated with AI that address the deeply unjust, unsustainable
and inequitable socio-economic system in which AI is entangled.[^09Taffel_102]
Fundamentally, according to the normative model of social ethics present
within political ecology, AI cannot be deemed ethical while it is
complicit in ecocide. We therefore conclude by outlining emerging
postcapitalist approaches that re-envision and prefigure less
ecologically destructive and more ‘ethical’ sociotechnical systems.

The structure of capitalist economies requires compound growth of at
least 2 to 3 percent GDP per annum.[^09Taffel_103] Economic growth strongly
correlates with material footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. While
widespread adoption of renewable energy enables the decoupling of
greenhouse gas emissions from GDP, the underlying correlation between
energy and GDP remains, and ‘renewable’ energy still requires
significant unrenewable materials. This means that the inevitable quest
for infinite growth under a capitalist mode of production is impossible
on a materially finite planet. Consequently, postcapitalist positions
broadly concur on the necessity of supplanting and replacing GDP as a
measure of socioeconomic wellbeing.[^09Taffel_104] GDP is a measure of economic
exchange value—the sum of monetary transactions within nation states—and
has been widely criticized for valuing things that are destructive,
including coal burning power stations, producing nuclear weapons and
increased hospital admissions. At the same time GDP fails to value
things that do not generate incorporate exchange value, including clean
air, biodiversity, unpaid domestic labour, and commons-based digital
ventures such as Wikipedia. Equally, GDP fails to account for
spectacular levels of inequality within nation states, so employing GDP
as an indicator of social progress fails to recognize that since the
1970s, within developed economies, growth has almost exclusively accrued
among the wealthiest while poverty levels have steadily risen.[^09Taffel_105]
Postcapitalist arguments are thus clear that GDP, with its focus on
exchange value, is an inadequate measure for evaluating what matters in
life.

While there has been significant debate within political ecology
surrounding the merits and potential shortcomings of degrowth,
ecomodernist and ecosocialist approaches,[^09Taffel_106] both
eco-socialists[^09Taffel_107] and proponents of degrowth[^09Taffel_108] argue for a
decommodification of the relationships between humans and ecosystems and
emphasize that the need for an economy based on use value. Nevertheless,
when discussing technology there are tensions between eco-socialist
positions which advocate for democratic centralizations such as
state-funded national digital public services and infrastructures[^09Taffel_109]
or platform socialism,[^09Taffel_110] and degrowth approaches that emphasize
conviviality as a means of creating non-alienated technologies that draw
upon forms of communing,[^09Taffel_111] including the free/open source software
and peer-to-peer movements.[^09Taffel_112] Rather than advocating for any
specific ‘solution’ we briefly highlight this diversity of
postcapitalist approaches in order to advance dialogue and solidarity
between those involved in promoting a range of ecosystem-centred
alternatives to technological solutionism and hyper-efficient ‘green’
capitalism.

As it stands, AI and data centers exhibit network effects and economies
of scale that lead towards the immense centralization associated with
hyperscale data centers and this in turn produces oligopolistic
corporate control over these systems and infrastructures.[^09Taffel_113] Although
AI, the internet and computers were all developed within capitalist
economies, the current, corporate-dominated model of AI infrastructure
is not inevitable. Indeed, a key contention of postcapitalist approaches
is that altering the governance of technologies can transform their
functioning in ways that markedly reduce ecosystem harms and social
inequalities. Platform socialists argue that current asymmetries of
power between corporations, and ecosystems (including humans) can be
meaningfully addressed by centralized public service models, such as
those used in many nations for healthcare, telecommunication, sewage
systems and other forms of infrastructure. Where a ‘natural
monopoly’[^09Taffel_114] occurs, a use-value led approach suggests managing
infrastructure as a socialised public good, rather than as private
commodities. Elsewhere, cooperatives, federated, and distributed
peer-to-peer systems, and other forms of digital commons suggest
decentralized alternatives. Further, moving away from exchange value as
a measure of wealth would entail that numerous harmful forms of AI would
no longer be deemed useful or valuable.

Eliminating harmful models of capitalist surveillance designed to nudge
citizens to engage in acts of unsustainable consumption, and corporate
hoarding of as much data as possible in the hope that there will
eventually be a way to monetize it,[^09Taffel_115] would enable significant
reductions in data storage and computational processing. This would go
some way toward reducing the current social and environmental harms AI
incurs, while affording growth in those areas where AI can support the
healing of ecosystems and communities rather than benefit the private
interests of those who control technology and associated infrastructure.
Within the context of data/digital colonialism,[^09Taffel_116] a key component of
this change must involve the decolonization of data[^09Taffel_117] and enhanced
technological sovereignty,[^09Taffel_118] enabling individuals and communities to
utilize their data for their own benefit. However, decolonization must
also go beyond data to address EUE.

It is critical to highlight the role of AI in the current extractivist,
capitalist system, a system that is causing a global ecological collapse
through rapacious overconsumption predicated upon spectacular levels of
social inequality within and between regions of the globe, and which can
be considered neither just nor ethical. Alongside addressing climate and
ecological debt, what is urgently required is a rapid decommodification
of the economic system in the economic core. This will enable those
living outside the core to reinstitute sovereignty over their resources,
technology, energy, and land. While there are contentious debates about
the appropriate ways to move beyond capitalism, a starting point is
acknowledging that we can. A political ecology perspective requires us
to strengthen our understanding of the possible roles of AI in the
process of postcapitalist transition and to develop a praxis around ‘AI
ethics’ and justice that incorporates these broad aims. We need much
more than an ethical plaster to cover the flawed structures and systemic
failures we face on a global scale.

    Technological Solutionism*, London: Penguin, 2014. Our use of
    technological solutionism is related to the term’s popularisation by
    Morozov, insofar as it demarcates a logic unique to 21st-century
    digital capitalism which seeks to resolve problems through
    optimization, efficiency and market-based computational
    technologies. Morozov productively outlines how solutionism
    exemplifies a desire to solve problems that do not meaningfully
    exist, as epitomized by smart fridges or bin cameras. While we
    concur with the critique of these technologies as needlessly
    extending corporate dataveillance, our critique of technological
    solutionism instead addresses how this logic adversely impacts
    contemporary responses to urgent ecological and social justice
    issues.
