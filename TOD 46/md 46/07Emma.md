# ‘Device Not Found’: Failure and Frustration in Critical Digital Methodologies

### Emma Fraser and Clancy Wilmott 

## Introduction

From their inception, all digital media technologies are failing.

Our everyday devices, phones, and computers are digital media machines,
and from the moment new computation technologies are developed they
enter a cycle of inevitable obsolescence. As such, the defining moment
of a piece of digital media technology is in its relation to perfection
and failure. Each release is more advanced and complete and more
perfect, than the technologies that came before.[^07Emma_1] Simultaneously, the
success of digital media is already eclipsed by whatever new
computational innovation is on the horizon. Every new app, platform, or
piece of hardware or software is implicitly a failure in relation to the
next more perfect update, version, or model.

In *Updating to Remain the Same*, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues that in
order to maintain the status quo of media consumption, constant updates
to software and hardware are needed in an enduring cycle of crisis and
digital maintenance.[^07Emma_2] This chapter presents a reconfiguration of
Chun’s original position: rather than updating to remain the same in a
constant state of renewal and progression, we argue that all digital
media technologies are never finished or complete, but always in a state
of comparative and increasing failure and decay. As Chun writes in her
conclusion, what matters is ‘what and how things linger’, rather than
‘the new and fading—the bleeding edge of obsolescence’.[^07Emma_3]

From this position, we ask: what would it mean to encounter digital
media as already failing — and what would it mean to use this as a
starting point for establishing a different kind of critical digital
methodology which critiques notions of contemporaneity and completeness?
Such questions shed new light on our relation to all — past, present and
future — digital media technologies. We have never been modern.[^07Emma_4]
Software and hardware (like fashion) have never been up to date.[^07Emma_5]

If we accept that digital media fail to be emergent, and only succeed in
being outmoded and perpetually unfinished (lingering on as the ephemera
of the contemporary technological moment that is always in-progress), we
can develop a critical and pedagogical frame informed by Chun and
others’ critiques of both digital media technology, and dominant
framings of computation and technological development. Central to this
approach is a move away from the fetishization of the new, opening up
playful and critical encounters with contemporary and historic digital
media technologies as spaces of perpetual failure and reframing them
from perfect machines with imperfect users to imperfect machines:
glitch-filled, design-limited, dust-ridden, bound by bodged code, and
held together by loose connections.

## Device Not Found

In digital media technologies — unique compositions of software and
hardware, computation, and silicon — failure is apparent across the
material and the symbolic. Consider two computers sitting side-by-side
in a teaching studio: a Macintosh 512k (c.1985), and a Macintosh SE (c.
1987). Their exteriors are covered in a residue of dust and grime left
behind by many hands and many commands ground into their ‘Snow
White’[^07Emma_6] design over the years, the patina of old technology.

Curious students discover with disappointment that the Mac 512k is
broken. A feature of the Mac 128k/512k is a small parameter RAM (PRAM)
battery slot in the back, which was used to hold basic memory functions
while the computer was off — a technical fix for the problem of a
portable computer that would otherwise wipe essential data (like time
and date, or user data) whenever it was unplugged and transported. A
portable personal computer that was already failing in its most basic
function from the very start. At some point in its previous 38 years of
life, a small 4.5v Eveready No. 523 battery has been inserted into this
slot and then forgotten — left to corrode, and eventually burst open. As
a result of design failure and human neglect — but also entropy and
obsolescence — corrosive material now coats the battery slot and has
begun to corrode the computer’s circuitry itself.

The newer version — or a more recently *failed* version — of this early
model, the Mac SE, was released without this external PRAM battery
feature, and as such it still turns on and functions as designed. For
students encountering this machine, the imperfections and failures of
the much-fetishized original Mac combine with a strong familiarity with
the fundamentals of its design. The antecedents of their own screen,
keyboard, and mouse and the Apple ecosystem provide a strange encounter
with failure as both a problem and possibility of modern technology.
Once they identify the power switch on the back, the Macintosh SE turns
on with a chime once familiar to many, but largely unrecognizable to
this generation of students. Students begin to explore a suite of System
(Mac O.S.) 4 software and applications, exclaiming as they make links
between old and new interfaces (playing with menus and system
preferences), and as features they take for granted (like the Spotlight
search) are frustratingly absent. Searching through their own indexes of
computation technology, they experiment between the awkwardness of the
machine and the magic of computing.

Between material and usability failures, students learn that digital
media technologies are bound to let us down, to break, to fail. With the
appropriate attitude, they can be met intentionally in their imperfect
state — expressly, critically. Here we understand ‘digital
instantiations of imperfection as elements of friction capable of
challenging the digital’s problematically frictionless veneer’.[^07Emma_7] This
frictionless veneer is in part a cultural perception that overlooks
‘social and machinic relations’ in order to fetishize the ‘magic’
workings of source code and programming, and invisibilizes the contact
points between user, ‘machine’, hardware, and software.[^07Emma_8] It also
includes the mystifying, ideological framing of computation as the drive
to perfect code and representation; computers as machines that simply
execute the desires of the masterful programmer.

Consolidating knowledge, information, process, and meaning, code becomes
logos. Code-as-logos inserts the abstraction of ‘software’ in place of
executed code and conflates meaning into action in the pursuit of some
essence of command and control through calculation.[^07Emma_9] Automated code
(in the form of, for example, compiled instructions or higher-order
programming languages that short-cut the dreary repetition of raw
computation via libraries and source code) becomes an exercise in
truth-telling. To command code is to render knowledge and information
into a unified language or form, to control a language without ambiguity
that simply ‘does what it says’; instruction and result in tandem.[^07Emma_10]
In programming languages, ‘\[o\]ne’s word creates something living’[^07Emma_11]
— yet this creation is, always, imperfect, whether in the gap between
meaning and action, user and machine, software and hardware, or writing
and execution, or in the friction between instrumental reasoning and
perpetual, illogical, obsessive reinvention.

Against such perfection and efficiency and the alchemical ‘sourcery’ of
source code,[^07Emma_12] we develop a pedagogical framing of failure as an
alternative mode for the study and design of all computational
technologies. The tension between playful, disruptive, and messy
experiences of technology, and the idealized fetish of mastery and
completion is the source of our claim that all digital media
technologies are always failing: not just in the way that media in
general fail to neatly signify (one of the interpretations of logos),
but in the way that computational technologies at the heart of the
digital media ecosystem fail to be error-free, fail to remain
up-to-date, fail to function as expected or intended. In their failure,
digital media technologies demand that we (academics, students,
designers) figure out through trial and error; that we push past the
veneer of perfection to find the productive frictions between function
and obsolescence, which rest in failure.

## States of Failure

The challenge for us as researchers and educators is to find critical
digital methodologies that reveal the frictions and patinas of digital
media technology from the point of failure, rather than the axiomatic
framework of perfect execution, novelty, and newness — at both the level
of pedagogy and of research. Key to this is a resistance against the
fantasy of command and total control that comes with what Chun describes
as the ‘executive power’[^07Emma_13] in programming — in our case, by making
room for students to explore so-called ‘old’ digital technologies
without guides or instructions, without prerequisite knowledge, and
without the default assumption of immediate success or legibility. Old
technologies provide an insight into the past and future of contemporary
tech, but also a uniquely low-risk space in which failure can be
embraced. In failure, the ‘executive power’ is humbled, and we see
ourselves and our computation critically. Further, this failure is more
transparent — we can pick apart the intersections between machine and
code and see the system more clearly in its unfamiliar familiarity.

Thus, we invite students to sit with frustration and uncertainty, to
flounder or make mistakes that might result in dead machines, missing
files, incorrect outputs, or error messages. ‘Device not found’ here
means execution incomplete; connection not quite made; attempt failed.
But it also marks the meeting point of user and machine and failure and
method. What does it mean for a device — a physical object that you can
see and touch — to be invisible to another device? What problem does it
pose, and what is the real failure here? Is it one of knowledge; of
hardware; of code or compatibility; of representation; of obsolescence?
Or is it the wider failure of the ever-present expectation that a
machine (anthropomorphized by language and logos) *knows* something we
don’t? That the machine’s code and software *does* something magical
that we ourselves cannot do? Is it we who are failing to work with the
machine, or is the machine always failing to meet us where we are?

By asking students to engage with technologies as they have (always)
failed, we also aim to draw students away from what Chun calls the
‘sourcery’ of source code: the reification of the executable command
that invisibly stitches language to action, reducing, or rendering
invisible, the steps of compilation and interpretation in-between.[^07Emma_14]
Practically, this approach requires a veritable scrapyard of ‘old media
tech’ — failed tech: Apple Macintoshes from the 1980s; Blackberries and
Palm Pilots; a Nokia 3310; Atari and ColecoVision gaming consoles;
floppy disks; and outdated operating systems like Fortran. Importantly,
it is not only devices familiar in the history of computing — like the
Macintosh Classic — that should be included, but those which have failed
to have any significant legacy at all, like the lesser-known
Intellivision gaming console by Mattel, or the iPod’s (more) failed
peers like Microsoft Zune or SanDisk Sansa.

From the moment it was developed, the Macintosh 128k was already failing
in relation to its successors: the 512k, which provided a more
appropriate quantity of RAM to run the desired programs of the time, but
also the Apple SE, the Macintosh Plus, and the (now classic) Macintosh
Classic, all of which contained updates to their hardware and software
that addressed prior failures and rendered existing models obsolete. To
use a computer from 1984 today is to encounter failures known at the
time, but also the failures that emerge more clearly as we have become
accustomed to working with these machine’s successors. These are
failures of design (the choice of 128k RAM to keep costs down meant the
first Macintosh couldn’t run many common programs), time-induced
hardware failures of disk drives and batteries, but also stark software
failures with respect to accessibility and usability.[^07Emma_15]

Simple tasks — finding the power button, for instance — become an
exploration of failure. Not just failure of the broken machine, but of
connection, and of recognition. ‘Why that symbol?’, students ask,
referring to the ‘0’ and ‘|’ at the top and bottom of the power switch.
These seem familiar, because they are contemporary signifiers for
powering on and off (see Figure 2.1). The answer lies in the basic
function of the machine: it depicts an electric circuit, closed or open
— the most fundamental aspect of analogue computers and binary code: on
and off — obfuscated by the increasing distance between command and
execution, action, meaning, and function with each iteration of
computing.

This isn’t simply a failure of young people with old tech. This common
experience of failure is cross—generational and speaks to the permanent
failure of all digital media technology in one way or another: we (the
authors) did not know how to turn on and off our new Macbook Pro
machines. The on/off signification has been ‘smoothed’ over in newer
models, demonstrating — through failure — that the distance between
command and action is increasingly obscured by ‘the digital’s
problematically frictionless veneer’.[^07Emma_17] In older technologies the
same failure resides in a boxy mouse that is difficult to maneuver, a
cursor that drags across the screen more slowly than we are used to, a
program that requires shortcuts to run (and the associated knowledge),
or a switch or button where there might now be a menu or a voice
command. What we can learn from these moments of failure and disconnect
is the fetishization of code and programming, which invisibilizes
hardware, but also the fundamental experience of using technology as one
of never quite being there, never finally arriving, and never actually
taking off: a promise that is never really fulfilled.

## Critical Digital Methodologies

In digital media ‘the ephemeral endures’ — even as it fades. Just as our
old Apple Macintosh hardware is degenerating, our social-technological
relations are determined within a ‘present that is always degenerating’,
but simultaneously resuscitated from ‘undead’ information accessed via
digital media machines.[^07Emma_18] When the students finally get the Apple SE
working, they view files unchanged since the 1990s: saves of
undergraduate essays and PhD data, ephemeral media salvaged through
lines of code and saved in file sizes (4kb, 8kb) that they find
difficult to comprehend. ‘This is hard’ they say, as they play games
like *Lode Runner* (see Figure 2.2), struggling with the slow feedback
from the keyboard and the blunt space of the blocky black and white
landscape. ‘You have to think ahead. Press the spacebar early!’ Too
late, another death and another failure. The game restarts and another
student takes the keyboard. Another set of hands wear down the plastic,
the connections, and the circuitry, trying to ‘figure out how’ in the
space between execution and action.

We developed this pedagogical approach with failure as guiding principle
from the start. Coding and programming are forged in failure. Machines
and code are fetishized as world-making media even as they degenerate.
As a result, our students don’t encounter technology just expecting it
to successfully run or function. Through doing, they learn to understand
digital media technologies as systems, devices, and interfaces that
*never* ‘just work’, but in fact constantly fail. Without critical
intervention, source code remains a mysterious backend, obfuscating the
machine in a way that emphasizes the power of the programmer as
commander, without questioning this knowledge, and without thinking
about the gaps between meaning and execution.

Critical digital practices can operate in a mode perpendicular to more
traditional forms of computer science; where the latter tries to solve
problems through technology, the former attempts to intervene in
technology *as both problem and possibility*. If we only focus on
teaching students perfect mastery of program, code, and hardware, we
deny them space to work things out through play, to learn from errors
and disconnections, and to understand computation not as the increasing
collapse of meaning and action, or an idealized practice that will
eventually disappear the machine, but in fact a profound meeting of
intention and chance, user and hardware, mistake, cover-up, invention,
and perpetual failure. Rather than approaching failure as a nuisance
element of computational practice — an element that stymies the search
for perfect execution, and which is the exception rather than the norm —
this chapter has argued that critical practices *must* embrace the
constant frustration and uncertainty of computing, particularly in the
digital media sphere. This awareness can be built up through working
with old technology and broken components and sensors and working
against the culture of novelty, mastery, and invisibility built through
computational disciplines. It can also be recognized in the many false
starts, misfires, and random connections of contemporary technological
design. To resist the fetish of computing[^07Emma_20], digital and
computational pedagogy and research must engage in a more
failure-oriented method of teaching and interpreting digital media
technologies, a method that challenges the smooth veneer of perfection,
where critical potential can be found against the illusion of
frictionless computation, the mastery of programming, and the hubris of
the new.
