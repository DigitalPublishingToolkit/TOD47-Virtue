# Who Cares About Fågeltofta? Failing to Grieve Landscapes in Transition

### Li Jönsson and Kristina Lindström

Standing in the middle of a field in Fågeltofta, Sweden, we see an open
landscape featuring fields with different crops, grassing cows, some
houses, farms, a church, and a closed petrol station. Cars rush through
the village heading somewhere else. At first glance, there is nothing
striking about this place. However, what is not possible to see with the
naked eye is that Fågeltofta is an area that holds a lot of hope for
transitioning into a post-fossil society. If we could look below the
growing crops and grass, underneath our wellies, we would discover
vanadium. This is a hard, silvery-grey, malleable transition metal
classified by the European Union as critical for future innovation,
meant to be used in batteries storing sun and wind energy. Vanadium is
therefore considered important for enabling continued mobility in a
fossil-free society. For those living in the area, harvesting vanadium
would radically alter both their local landscape and living conditions
as it would require mines to open.

As researchers drawing from participatory design, feminist
techno-science, and cultural geography, we will give an account of an
ongoing research project meant to mobilize a heterogeneous understanding
of hope as well as loss in a transition towards a fossil-free society.
Our interest in vanadium was initiated by a curiosity about how to
productively engage with the disruption of a landscape, literally a
field, in the name of future innovation. This was explored through an
installation called *Clayworks*, connected to a series of workshops
where we invited inhabitants to engage with the issue of landscapes in
transition using clay from Fågeltofta.

In this chapter, we will discuss Fågeltofta as a potential future
‘shadow place’[^15Li_1] that creates what can be described as a
‘pre-solastalgic state’.[^15Li_2] Drawing on our engagement with *Clayworks*,
we will discuss the need for and potential failure to grieve landscapes
in transition. We will focus on this failure as we argue it reaches far
beyond this event into contemporary accounts of how to understand and
approach the transition into a post-carbon society. In other words, we
believe that there is something important to learn if we approach this
work as a potential failure.

## Fågeltofta — A Future Shadow Place?

In 1868, the area around Fågeltofta was hit by two disasters. Spring
came early that year, and the animals were released to graze on the
green meadows. As per usual, the farmers sowed their crops when the soil
was ready for the small seeds to start sprouting, but the plants quickly
froze as winter returned with full force at the end of May. Later that
year, this abrupt weather change had large consequences and led to
famine. Due to the almost non-existent harvest, the farmers also
struggled to imburse their lease of land. The landowner, Count Hamilton,
seized the opportunity to take control of the land himself and
terminated their contracts. The farmers lost not only their land as
their source of food but also their houses, which were taken down, clay
brick by clay brick. Some of them were rebuilt by the Count to provide
houses for lumbermen. Other houses disappeared, leaving no ruins or
marks due to being built with the clay from the surrounding fields.
Today, a generation of newer houses make up the village, while the local
church predating the disasters stands in solitude, surrounded by fields
instead of houses.

The land surrounding Fågeltofta and the clay that was once used to build
the local villages has gained new value. The aluminium slate that hides
in the soil is predicted to contain vanadium. Finding and extracting it
requires special skills, a lot of capital, and access to large areas of
land. In Sweden, therefore, anyone who meets the conditions to exploit
deposits can be granted a permit, under the so-called Mineral Act (a
legislation about the right to undertake exploration and exploitation
that came into force in 1992), regardless of who owns the land. Local
citizens have gathered to protest these plans, partly doubting claims
being made that this is done for environmental reasons. One of the
biggest concerns and worries for locals has been the fact that one
literally loses the right to land and properties if the chief mining
inspector grants a permit for the exploration. In Fågeltofta, an
exploration permit has been granted, but no actual test drilling has yet
been done. The locals are waiting in uncertainty regarding the future of
the landscapes on which their homes stand.

Although this might seem to echo the historical narrative of a place
with unjust power distributions and unsustainable processes, we might
also recognize the dilemma that if mines are not opened here, then where
might they be opened? What other places will become what Australian
philosopher and feminist Val Plumwood[^15Li_3] refers to as shadow places?
These are places that remain invisible but supply the rest of the world
with energy, raw materials, and other resources. The existence of many
loved places and the ways of living they support are, in other words,
enabled by shadow places. Similarly, vanadium inscribes a hope for the
continued high energy consumption that allows us not to have to change
much in our everyday lives. []{#_heading=h.1fob9te .anchor}

## Clayworks

To stage and facilitate a hands-on discussion in relation to some of the
above dilemmas, we created the installation *Clayworks* (Figure 10.2).
The installation invited people passing by to make a clay brick by
following some simple instructions. They were asked to mark their brick
with the name of a place that faces a potential transition and might be
in need of care.

We hosted the installation in a time-worn shabby shed during the yearly
local artisan fair and gathered a pile of clay from Fågeltofta. The clay
had been unearthed by a farmer from Fågeltofta and possibly contained
vanadium. The story of Fågeltofta’s two disasters and the prospect for
future mining was nailed to the shed. *Clayworks* was installed for six
months, and occasionally, some of our project team would facilitate clay
brick workshops announced to the public through the organising art fair.

In *Clayworks*, our attempt was to draw attention and attachments to the
actual place, history, and future by inviting participants to literally
touch, tinker with, and handle the local clay and form it into bricks.
The bricks resembled a memorial of the village that disappeared. This
narrative of loss in the past was interwoven with contemporary worries
of places and landscapes in transition through the invitation to
inscribe each clay brick with the name of a place participants cared
for.

Several of the people who took part in making clay bricks shared stories
and worries about the experience of places in transition. Some stories
were about already experienced changes in landscapes. A couple carved
the name of an overgrown brook close to their house and used it to raise
concerns of how drainage for agricultural land reclamation has
negatively affected local biodiversity. Many carved names of coastal
settlements and expressed worries about how the coastlines currently
suffered from erosion and potential rising sea levels in the future. A
woman voiced her concern about the global shortage of sand and gravel
used for construction as she carved the name of a local gravel pit that
she had witnessed growing lately. Some people had difficulty coming up
with any particular place. Instead, they would inscribe names of names
of well-known beautiful places, such as beaches and nature reserves,
popular with locals and tourists (Figure 10.3).

‘Baskebadet’, which is one of the popular beaches in the area. Photo

Six months passed. When we were about to gather the bricks that had
dried in the sun, we felt a sense of failure. Had we managed to
cultivate care, attachments, and commitments to places and landscapes
such as Fågeltofta that are at risk of irreparable destruction and that
too few people know about or have visited? Or, was something else
required for cultivating care and commitment? A question posed by a
resident in Fågeltofta echoed in our heads: Who cares about Fågeltofta?

## Failure to Grieve

*Clayworks* is part of a three-year project concerned with mobilising a
heterogeneous understanding of hope as well as grief in a transition
towards a fossil-free society. In *Clayworks*, our particular focus was
on landscapes that are going through or are about to undergo changes
that might cause worry and distress for people who care about those
places. The main narrative of *Clayworks* was centred on Fågeltofta, its
past, and its potential future.

In the context of climate change, species extinction, and ecological
damage caused by human activities, several scholars argue for the need
to rework how we cope with losses and to develop a more nuanced
understanding of the kind of work grief can do.[^15Li_4] For example, Cunsolo
and Landman[^15Li_5] argue for moving beyond a Freudian understanding of
mourning, which suggests that successful mourning implies overcoming
that which has been lost to become whole again. A failure to do so would
imply a state of melancholia, preventing a person from moving on. Coping
with the loss of species or landscapes caused by human activity might,
however, suggest other understandings of mourning and what it means to
move on. Influenced by Butler’s[^15Li_6] articulation of grief as
transformative, Cunsolo and Landman[^15Li_7] argue that ecological grief is
less about forgetting or overcoming that which has been lost and more
about recognising one’s attachments to it. To be able to ‘move on’ then
requires allowing oneself to be transformed. For example, the loss of a
place that you have a strong connection to will also change who you are.

To capture this kind of ‘existential distress’[^15Li_8] experienced by people
when ‘directly confronted by unwelcome change in their loved home
environment’,[^15Li_9] Albrecht articulated the concept of solastalgia. The
word solastalgia is a neologism based on the word nostalgia. Albrecht
describes nostalgia as a kind of homesickness experienced when being
away from home, whereas solastalgia refers to ‘the homesickness you have
when still being at home’.[^15Li_10] Although the concept of solastalgia is
highly relevant in relation to the narratives that were enacted through
*Clayworks*, these narratives does not fit perfectly within the
definition of solastalgia. Instead, it can be understood as an
expression of a ‘pre-solastalgic state’[^15Li_11] that enquires into worries
‘about the possible passing of the familiar and its replacement by that
which does not sit comfortably within one’s sense of place’.[^15Li_12] In
other words, the distress experienced in the context of Fågeltofta and
many of the other narratives that emerged in *Clayworks* were not
necessarily about something that had already happened but concerned the
distress of that which might be about to happen.

Looking back at the narrative of both past and potential future losses
of Fågeltofta, it is evident that there are similarities but also
differences between them. There are similarities in the sense that both
narratives involve experienced or potential loss of landscapes with
implications for people living there. There are, however, also
differences that might suggest different kinds of emotional or affective
responses, such as how the crop failure caused by cold weather is in the
past, whereas the plan for vanadium mines is an anticipated future.
Furthermore, the crop failure and following famine were not
self-inflicted in the same ways the future mining plans are.

Although grieving is always hard and requires work, it is easier to
grieve losses that have happened and where we do not see ourselves as
culpable. But how do we move from these recognisable forms of grief
towards a grief concerned with losses that are ongoing, uncertain, and
caused by human activities? How do we strike up practices that can
support pre-solastalgic grief?

Perhaps we can find some insights in what Barr describes as ‘resistant
ecological mourning’.[^15Li_13] This articulation builds on the work of Rae,
who describes a kind of mourning that resists bringing grief through
catharsis and instead provokes questions on the causes of past or
potential future loss and which can act as a ‘warning about future
losses that could occur given the continuation of the status quo’.[^15Li_14]
Drawing on her own and others’ artistic practices, Barr[^15Li_15] argues for
narratives and artistic expressions that acknowledge and bring past
losses into the present, not to simply remember that which has been lost
but as a reminder of the continued devastation that will take place
unless there is action and change. The difficulty here is that we often
fail to imagine what that change could be and find alternatives to the
well-trodden modernistic path. Furthermore, a defining feature of
solastalgia is the personal and political powerlessness in the lived
experience of environmental change,[^15Li_16] echoed by some of the
inhabitants of Fågeltofta along with others expressing a need for
resistance in light of risking losing their home place to a future mine.

that participants cared for in multiple ways. Photo credit: Li Jönsson.

Seeing the drying clay bricks next to each other, names of potential
future shadow places like Fågeltofta were positioned next to names of
places (Figure 10.4) that we can understand as beautiful and cherished,
places to which the individual participants had a strong sense of
connection and belonging. This might not be surprising given that we
asked participants to write down the name of a place they cared for.
Nonetheless, the ways in which different locations and experiences were
brought into *Clayworks* often enacted these places as singular, and we
often failed to recognize the ways in which these places interconnected.
Although the bricks were placed next to each other to indicate their
connectedness, we failed to account for the ways in which caring for one
place might have implications for other places. Plumwood argues that
‘recovering a storied sense of land and place is a crucial part of the
restoration of meaning’.[^15Li_17] However, she argues, if we treat places of
belonging as singular, without recognising their dependence on other
places, we run the risk of generating a false sense or understanding of
these places and what is at stake in our care for them.

## Concluding Discussion

In this chapter, we have looked at the failure to attend to, care for,
and recognize places in transition. We have responded to this by aiming
to strike up practices of pre-solastalgic grief. What characterizes this
form of grief is that it is anticipatory, and that the potential loss is
implicated in our ways of living. In other words, it is a grief
concerned with a potential future loss that we, to some extent, are
responsible for, even though we often lack a sense of agency in the
matter. In line with Cunsolo and Landman,[^15Li_18] we argue that grieving
successfully in this context would not simply imply accepting the loss
and moving on. Instead, we argue for grieving practices that invite
hesitation regarding what is at stake in moving on and instead open up
for transformation.

To support this form of grief, we argue for narratives and material
engagements that are situated in specific places and draw their
histories and potential future together. Importantly, we also argue for
extending this care and concerns beyond the singular place, individual,
animal, or plant and instead recognising the ways in which places and
ways of living are interconnected. In many ways, our collective failure
seems to be in the resistance to see how imaginaries of becoming
fossil-free contribute to the creation of new shadow places and the
destruction of other lifeworlds. The question of ‘who cares about
Fågeltofta?’ can be expanded to other places with similar fates —
multiple potential future shadow places. Following Plumwood, there is
much to be said for having love for a specific individual, animal, or
place, but this is simply not enough. To nurture more ethical and
justice-driven worlds to grow, we need to recognize the fate of
Fågeltofta as a shared responsibility connected to our current practices
that construct these harmed places and their beings.

We would not say that our work in *Clayworks* fully managed to support
this collective and transformative form of grief. It should rather be
seen as a first sketchy attempt to collectively rehearse how to practise
pre-solastalgic grief. There is much to learn from our failures.

On a final note, calls for how to deal with vast ecological damage are
urgent, and our attempt to respond with the slow pace of lingering and
the hard work required to grieve might in many ways seem contradictory
to the need for action. Comparably, the response of opening mines to
harvest materials in the name of eco-innovation might be seen as a
direct and more productive contribution to the fossil-free transition.
Although problematic, this response is still a form of self-preservation
of our modern selves and lifestyles — a melancholic state of being where
ordinary routines are to be conserved. In light of this, we need to ask
if it is reasonable to sacrifice Fågeltofta to preserve our current
lifestyle and allow it to become a shadow place. Our response, to strike
up practices of pre-solastalgic grief, is meant to invite such questions
of sacrifice to become more publicly available, to allow for other
considerations of urgency to be balanced, to problematize the
disengagements of our fossil-dependent shadows, and to expand the
repertoire of possible responses for how to become fossil-free.
