# Acknowledgements

The editors would like to thank all the outstanding contributors for
their excellent responses to the theme. We would also like to thank
Geert Lovink and the excellent people at INC for making the \#failurists
publication a reality. We thank RMIT University Europe Barcelona team
for providing the workshop space and support in 2018 and to the then
Design & Creative Practice Research platform team, Esther Pierini and
Adelina Onicas. We thank Gretchen Coombs for her work early in the
process and for Eloise Florence assistance at the end.

Larissa would like to thank Jesper and David for their support and love
as well as all the wonderful people who attended the original workshop
in 2018 and to the other editors Sybille, Kat and Jen. Sybille wishes to
thank Alex Gekker, Emma Fraser, Sam Hind, Saniye Ince, Chris Perkins and
Clancy Wilmott for their inspiring discussions over the years about the
relation between failure, play and mapping. Kat would like to thank the
*Politics of Patents* (POP) research team for ongoing creative
discussions around practice research. The POP project has received
funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 819458). Jen
would like to thank Sally and Vivi for teaching me that love, failure
and forgiveness are action words; Claire G. Coleman and the Reworlders
for continuing the work of ‘playing in the dark’ together; and, and
Australia Council for the Arts for supporting the seeding work of the
Centre for Reworlding.
