# Erroneous Interventions into Infrastructure | *The &lt;&lt;&lt; Pirate Girls &gt;&gt;&gt; say...* 

### Nancy Mauro-Flude

*The &lt;&lt;&lt; Pirate Girls &gt;&gt;&gt; say...* is a performance
installation embracing Wi-Fi meshing assemblage and concrete poetry
driven by a software collage of venerable email protocols and
up-to-the-minute open AI code for conversational agents (Figures 17.1
and 17.2). The process of making the work incorporates an openness to
the fruits of the fiasco of failure when techno-socio-cultural
imbroglios of networked communication infrastructure malfunction (Figure
17.3). Rather than tiptoeing around obstructions in fear of a crash, the
ethos of failure is embraced, as it carries with it a chance to think
otherwise.

*The &lt;&lt;&lt; Pirate Girls &gt;&gt;&gt; say…* enacts interventions
in technical infrastructure against its habitual grain through aesthetic
and critical actions that extend beyond the practical function of the
code. Flagging the value of failure to the so-called common sense of the
smooth user experience (UX), the work offers the public a
reverse-engineered glimpse of counter-technology. These counter-cultural
sites became contested locations of lavish agonistic debate where
catastrophe is foregrounded. The intentionality of poetic assemblages of
broken chatbot prose trip up capitalist expectations of puritan tropes
of literal repair and recovery (Figures 17.3, 17.4, and 17.5). The
potency of such failure makes visible the seams and fissures of the
concealed undercurrents and schemata of web server infrastructure. To
conclude, *The &lt;&lt;&lt; Pirate Girls &gt;&gt;&gt; say...* is an
intervention into infrastructure, embracing failure and mayhem, and as a
techno-socio-cultural site of rupture. Is there a prototype here to be
developed?
