# Care-tographies: Finding Failure in Navigational Settings

### Sam Hind

## Introduction 

In this chapter I offer a methodological framework for how to think
about navigational failure, considering navigation as instituting
networks of care or ‘care-tographies’. In order to do so, I first lay
out the feminist understanding of care as a practical activity,
dependent upon specific ‘phases’ of care. Then, I consider how failure
has routinely been studied by scholars, in respect to events like train
crashes and nuclear accidents. In light of these efforts, some have
considered how theories of care might be applied to such failures,
offering an analysis of how ‘matters of care’ might crystallize,[^16Sam_1]
helping to prevent or alleviate the effects of technological or
organizational, failure. Building upon these insights, I consider how
navigation might be similarly understood through a care-tographic
framework, and how navigational devices, interfaces, and infrastructures
mediate caring relations between people and worlds. In the final two
vignettes, I briefly evidence how care is practiced in navigational
settings, with reference to protest events and autonomous vehicle tests.

## Care and Failure

Feminist political scholars Berenice Fisher and Joan Tronto identify
four phases of care,[^16Sam_2] neither temporal in form, nor ‘orderly
stages’[^16Sam_3] culminating in ‘some completion of the caring activity’.[^16Sam_4]
Each phase might be carried out by a single individual or ‘divided among
different individuals or groups,’[^16Sam_5] with each ordinarily ‘intertwined
in chaotic and contradictory styles’,[^16Sam_6] in which care might co-exist
with carelessness, or caregiver might become care-receiver. Thus,
locating care is tricky. For instance, ‘care giving may proceed where no
one any longer cares about the original situation’,[^16Sam_7] say when housing
support is provided to an evicted family. In such a case, ‘the original
situation’ of the eviction (arguably a situation where care is
noticeably absent) may or may not be a factor in the resulting decision
to provide housing support (merely that the family now require housing).
In any case, searching for care involves analytical skill, and
attunement to the conditions that make care possible.

Firstly, care involves *being attentive*. In this phase of the caring
process, one must decide to ‘care about’ something,[^16Sam_8] with the
judgement being more an ‘orientation rather than a motivation’,[^16Sam_9]
driven by finite resources, time, knowledge, or ability. Secondly, care
requires taking *responsibility*. In this phase, care becomes an action,
requiring ‘more continuous time spent and more explicit knowledge of the
situation than does caring about’.[^16Sam_10] Thirdly, care requires
*maintenance*, with care understood as a continual, iterative, activity
rather than a single, declarative act. Here caregiving involves being
responsive to changing ‘moment-by-moment or day-by-day conditions’[^16Sam_11]
that might demand the revision of any ‘caregiving strategy’
devised.[^16Sam_12] Then lastly, care involves *feedback*, constitutive of any
care*giving*, in which one must be aware of, and responsive to, the
*receiving* of care. Here the needs and desires of the people receiving
care must be understood, such that the provision of care be tailored
accordingly, and that care itself can achieve its stated or implicit
aims.

Taken together, these phases constitute care as a set of inter-connected
practices, rather than simply a moral ethic or principle. Through their
asynchronous interweaving, these phases of care form what I have called
‘care-tographies’, networks of care relations drawn between people by
the things they do.[^16Sam_13]

Technological failures have commonly been studied by science and
technology studies (STS) scholars, sociologists, and geographers,
whether in the context of nuclear accidents, train crashes, or
electricity blackouts.[^16Sam_14] Whilst much of this work has offered
sociological or socio-technical analyses of why particular technologies
or systems ‘fail’ through reference to ideas around complexity,
multiplicity, relationality, and materiality, few provide a
methodological framework for finding failure. By incorporating feminist
theories of care, some STS scholars have shifted discussion from how
failure might be understood through addressing ‘concerns’ (a broken
part, a forged safety certificate)[^16Sam_15] to how it might be understood as
a failure to offer and maintain curiosity, attention, affect,
responsibility, responsiveness, and thus care itself.[^16Sam_16] Fisher and
Tronto provide the necessary methodological foundations with which to
locate, and analyze failure itself: through the lens of care, care work,
and the practice of taking care.

## Navigational Failure and Care

Building on Fisher and Tronto’s feminist work, and extending existing
scholarship on failure, I understand navigational failure as conditional
on care, and the activation, maintenance, or suspension of a caring
process. In this, navigational failure might broadly be attributed to a
lack of care at any one moment, whether a lack of attention by a hiker
who misses a path, an overworked driver who misses a turn, a mapping
company who depreciates a cartographic product, or a development company
who renames a neighborhood. In each case we might argue that a
navigational ‘failure’ (a missed turn, an out-of-date map) has occurred
or has an increased chance of occurring, and that a lack of care might
be attributed to the failure.

Thinking about maps and navigation as matters of care is nothing new.
Monica Stephens, for instance, has examined how childcare facilities are
often left off digital mapping platforms like OpenStreetMap (OSM),
whilst Valentina Carraro has considered how social navigation apps like
Waze warn (‘white, middle-class’) users of dangerous areas in
Israel/Palestine.[^16Sam_17] Significant examples of navigational failure that
invite a care-ful analysis include the 2012 Apple Maps failure evidenced
by misplaced labels and ‘melting’ satellite imagery[^16Sam_18] or the 2022
Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Google Maps disabled their live
traffic feature to protect local users.[^16Sam_19] Both of these cases might
be framed as particular kinds of technological ‘failures’, either in
reference to database issues (as with Apple Maps) or location-tracking
(Google Maps). However, both examples can also be considered as failing
to offer and maintain care. In the Apple Maps case, the launch of a new
product suddenly rendered routine navigation hazardous. In the Google
Maps case continuing to offer the same live traffic feature potentially
exposed local users to Russian attack.

In the following two navigational vignettes I expand on this prior work,
considering how each case can be evaluated using a ‘care-tographic’
framework, as well as examining how navigational situations elicit
specific aspects of care itself. Whilst the first vignette highlights
how care is iterative and requires ongoing evaluation, the second
vignette shows how the accumulated burden of responsibilities can easily
lead to tragedy.

## Vignette 1: Protest Mapping 

At 11pm on 30 June 2020, a new national security law was imposed in Hong
Kong, severely restricting freedom of speech and free assembly in the
territory.[^16Sam_20] A year before, citizens had taken to the streets to
protest a controversial extradition bill, the first mass protests since
the 2014 ‘Umbrella Revolution’.[^16Sam_21] In doing so, several protest
mapping projects sprung up, including HKmap.live and 103.hk.[^16Sam_22]
Following the protests in 2019, HKmap.live had been removed from the
Apple App Store citing public safety concerns, continuing as a dynamic,
web-accessible map only.[^16Sam_23] In contrast, 103.hk published regular
static, digital image-based maps. Both used Telegram channels to push
cartographic updates to subscribers.[^16Sam_24] I have previously written
about how both projects cultivated forms of care towards protesters,
helping them navigate dangerous situations and encounters with the
police.[^16Sam_25] But here I want to emphasize three aspects.

Firstly, that protest mapping requires *self-care*, in which not only
map users are cared for, but map makers too. As the 103.hk team
emphasized to its cartographic volunteers, ‘the map is not as important
as you are’,[^16Sam_26] echoing Tronto’s later addition of a fifth phase of
care, ‘solidarity’.[^16Sam_27] Secondly, that protest mapping requires
*resilient care infrastructures* in order to offer a sustainable,
effective, and robust navigational service. As the 103.hk team
acknowledged, reporting protocols, including a standardized system for
communicating incidents, was integral to their project. Thirdly, that
protest mapping needs an understanding of when care needs *expire*.
While the 103.hk team had largely perfected the art of representing
incidents on the map, they struggled to deal with incidents that *no
longer needed to be represented*. In a time-critical and
resource-intensive environment, knowing when care was no longer required
was vital.

## Vignette 2: Autonomous Driving 

At 9:58pm on 18 March 2018, an Uber ATG autonomous vehicle killed a
pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, in Tempe, Arizona (USA).[^16Sam_28] As a crash
investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
later confirmed, Herzberg had been hit whilst walking her bicycle across
northbound North Mill Avenue, a four-lane arterial route in the north of
the city.[^16Sam_29] At the time of impact, the vehicle had been undertaking a
second loop of an established test route routinely driven since 2017 by
the fleet of modified Volvo XC90s operated by Uber ATG in Tempe.[^16Sam_30]
The ‘vehicle operator’ behind the wheel was Rafaela Vasquez, an employee
with the company since June 2017, responsible for a range of tasks
whilst the vehicle was in autonomous mode.[^16Sam_31] Here I want to emphasize
three aspects of the tragic event.

Firstly, according to the NTSB report, the Uber ATG vehicle failed to
*account* for Herzberg. 5.6 seconds before she was hit, the vehicle’s
on-board developmental automated driving system (ADS) detected and
classified Herzberg as a vehicle. After a further eight new
classifications in which she was also categorized as stationary and as
an ‘unknown object’, 0.2 seconds before impact Herzberg was classified
for a final time as a bicycle.[^16Sam_32] At no point was Herzberg correctly
identified or classified as a pedestrian walking with a bicycle.

Secondly, Vasquez herself failed to *maintain attention*. Between 9:16pm
and 9:59pm (one minute after impact), Vasquez’s personal mobile phone
was alleged to have been streaming a TV show.[^16Sam_33] Using eye-tracking
analysis, NTSB investigators determined that Vasquez had glanced down
towards the center console of the vehicle (where they believed her
personal mobile phone to be) 23 separate times in the three minutes
before crash.[^16Sam_34] One of the principle tasks of the vehicle operator
was to monitor the driving environment, ready to take control of the
wheel in an emergency, something Vasquez had failed to do to avoid a
crash.[^16Sam_35]

Thirdly, Uber ATG failed to sufficiently *take care of* their vehicle
operators. Five months prior to the crash, the company had reduced the
number of vehicle operators in the vehicle during each test from two to
one. This ‘consolidation of responsibilities’[^16Sam_36] meant a single
individual was responsible for a suite of ongoing tasks, from monitoring
the road, to flagging driving infractions on a dashboard-mounted
device.[^16Sam_37] The extra burden placed on Vasquez was a significant factor
in Herzberg’s death.

These are not the only aspects of the event that can be evaluated with
reference to care but the aspects that help to make sense of the various
intersecting ‘failures’ that created the conditions for the fatal
crash.[^16Sam_38] By approaching them as matters of care, or more
appropriately, as matters of a *lack of care*, the tragic circumstances
of the navigational situation can be better understood.

## Conclusion

In this chapter I have offered a methodological framework for how to
examine navigational failures, considering navigation as instituting
networks of care or ‘care-tographies’. In this, navigational failures
can be seen as being precipitated through the relative presence, or
absence, of caring practices and strategies. More specifically, such
failures can be considered through a feminist lens of care, in which
possible ‘phases’ of care may be identified as part of the provision of
navigational assistance in a range of navigational settings.

In the two short vignettes, I have considered how a care-tographic
approach might help to draw out specific navigational relations in the
mapping of protest events and the testing of autonomous vehicles. In
both cases, to understand how mapping requires diligent, patient work in
often dangerous and either physically exhausting or mentally numbing
conditions. A care-tographic approach offers the possibility of locating
moments at which the normal state of things breaks down and of drawing
attention to the routine manual work behind digital platforms and
nominally ‘autonomous’ machines,[^16Sam_39] where the experience of performing
such work is situated somewhere between intolerable burden and boredom.

For scholars of navigation, feminist theories of care also provide a
significant, but often overlooked, approach to understanding how
navigational settings are constructed, how navigational technologies
nominally ‘fail’, who suffers when they fail, and why. For mapmakers,
designers, and software engineers, a care-tographic framework might
serve as an evaluative tool for critical, egalitarian map design and
implementation, catering to the situated needs of those who require
navigational assistance the most.
