# Failure is a Project[^20Nanna_1]

### Nanna Verhoeff and Iris van der Tuin

> An independent, diamond open-access journal redefining failure.[^20Nanna_2]

This is the tagline of the *Journal of Trial & Error (JOTE)*, a journal
set up and run by graduate students in the two-year master’s program
History and Philosophy of Science at Utrecht University, The
Netherlands. *JOTE* publishes short empirical articles that zoom in on
the question ‘what went wrong?’ in research projects across the natural
sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities and in
interdisciplinary settings. ‘Empirical’ here is broadly conceived as the
articles are meant to conceptualize ‘empirical and experimental studies
which have produced null, unexpected, negative, or mixed results’,
‘incomplete findings’, or findings that cannot be brought to ‘a closed,
cohesive narrative’.[^20Nanna_3]

The journal then invites senior researchers to comment on the
disciplinary aspects of the research that is reported on as well as
inviting scholars from science and technology studies (STS), sociology
of scientific knowledge (SSK), and history and philosophy of science
(HPS) to reflect practically and/or fundamentally on the structure of
situated experimentation and on the sources of concrete cases of
‘error.’ *JOTE* itself is an example of the third type of articles that
the journal publishes: meta-research articles that reflect the tradition
of the research of academic research. Here, one may think of the science
of team science (SciTS). Additionally, the journal publishes rejected
grant applications and peer-reviews so as to — in the tradition of STS —
open the black box of scholarly work and academic functioning even
further. Grant applications are published for three reasons:

> First, they are valuable in and of themselves as pieces of preliminary
> research. Second, they contain metadata that catalogue the ideas,
> hypotheses, and theoretical perspectives within an academic field.
> Third, they offer historians insight into the non-linear development
> of scientific ideas and can therefore be used as metadata on the
> trends and biases in the process of awarding grants.[^20Nanna_4]

What is interesting about the last-mentioned category specifically and
about *JOTE* in general is the attitude as it comes across. The online
journal breathes youthfulness or ‘science in the making’,[^20Nanna_5] which is
to say that things like the ‘replication crisis’ in science, the demands
of the Open Science movement, or the folding of preliminary research
(past) into industrial and tech applications (present) and/or the
funding of future research are taken up confidently as defining features
of 21^st^-century scholarship and academic life. By affirming that the
metadata of research must be captured for historians and brought into
circulation today as well as that science develops non-linearly, *JOTE*
consciously situates itself in the ‘algorithmic condition’.[^20Nanna_6] After
all, today’s science is being conditioned by and adds to the
computational procedures that drive the workings of the internet as the
global and dynamic externalized collective brain that stores, makes
accessible, and transmits knowledge, information, data, and, indeed,
affects.

In the contemporary world in which both *JOTE* and scholarly research in
general are situated, and within which we, as scholars, peer-reviewers,
and, quite simply, individuals live our professional and private lives,
change is the new stability. This characteristic aspect of the
algorithmic condition renews the academic, artistic, and activist
interest in failure as paradox. Failures are both obstacles and sites of
movement. They are blockages as well as a generative force. This being
the case, the negative connotation of failure itself (failure vs.
success) needs adjusting.[^20Nanna_7] This is precisely what the students behind
*JOTE* are teaching us when they write that they are concerned about
‘the publication pressures that researchers face — especially junior
investigators — in their pursuit of a career in science’.[^20Nanna_8] According
to their second tagline, ‘\[t\]here is a gap between what is researched
and what is published. *JOTE* aims to close that gap’.[^20Nanna_9] What gets
published usually goes accompanied by an air of linearity, success, and
grandeur, whereas the latter features are not the features of science as
it is daily done. The students write:

> Publicly, science is thought of as an unambiguous set of operations
> that gleans truth from chaos. By applying a set of specialized
> methodologies in a well-delineated process, the ‘blooming, buzzing
> confusion’ of experience can be quantified, categorized, and
> systematized. But in practice, science is quite messy. Experiments
> rarely work on the first try or as expected, results rarely falsify
> hypotheses directly, and knowledge is gained in small, incremental
> steps instead of great leaps. This process of fine-tuning is at odds
> with the public image of science as an enterprise designed for
> consistent large-scale discovery.[^20Nanna_10]

In the reality of science in the making, failure is, quite simply, daily
practice. Only when the public image of science — an image that also
features in university lecture halls and in popular news media — is
projected back onto the everyday reality of lab scientists and desk and
archival researchers do their experiences with ‘chaos,’ ‘confusion,’
‘mess,’ ‘incrementality,’ and ‘fine-tuning’ come to carry negative
connotations of failure. When the starting point is practice, a
symmetrical approach of alternating successes and failures comes within
reach. This approach seems to drive *JOTE,* as well as the algorithmic
condition per se.

The field of science and technology studies has long been interested in
research and development failures. Research and development failures
form an excellent entry point for a symmetrical anthropology that does
not want to import assumptions about binaries such as old-new,
true-false, and good-bad into its analyses, refraining from imposing
value on the networks studied. In *Aramis, or the Love of Technology*,
anthropologist of science Bruno Latour discusses the innovative public
transport system, Aramis, that was prepared for use in Paris from the
late 1960s until it was suddenly abandoned in the early 1980s. Latour
assembles as many voices about this sociotechnological failure as
possible. Failures linger in the space between ‘started’ and ‘finished,’
and as such they remain projects. ‘About technological *projects*’,
Latour argues, ‘one can only be subjective. Only those projects that
turn into objects, institutions, allow for objectivity. \[...\] Projects
drift; that’s why they’re called research projects’.[^20Nanna_11] The
well-functioning transport innovation died a premature death because of
a lacking number of sustained linkages between, and crossings of, social
and technical systems. The innovation ended up not being networked
enough and it is only possible to retroactively pinpoint why Aramis had
to fail by combining as many test reports as possible. For one thing,
Latour’s multivoiced systemic functional analysis into who killed Aramis
demonstrates that the project has indeed produced a lot of viewpoints.

‘Projects drift; that’s why they’re called research projects’, wrote
Latour. And this is precisely what the students behind *JOTE* want to
embrace. They write ‘“trial and error” is an inherent and fundamentally
collaborative mechanism of the scientific process, whereby scientists
share knowledge of both successes and failures to inform future
endeavors. To know what is, we must know what is not’.[^20Nanna_12] What
graduate student Sean Devine and his peers write is, indeed, refreshing,
but it is also conceptually precise and, in the algorithmic condition,
incredibly up to date. Distinct from failure as lack (a deficiency) that
is at risk of getting essentialized and taken for granted as a trait,
failure as a verb (an act of failing) refers to unexpected moves,
glitches, or hiccups in bodies, interactions, or relations with often
productive consequences for those humans and nonhumans involved. Owing
to such unforeseen happenings and unlooked for results, ‘failures’ are
characterized by change and transition rather than stability.

Given that glitches often occur today in all-pervasive human-computer
systems interaction, change is the new stability indeed. Anthropologist
Arjun Appadurai and media theorist Neta Alexander define ‘habitual
failure’ as ‘that which changes nothing: the non-event or the rapidly
dismissed encounter with the helplessness of users and consumers’.[^20Nanna_13]
Appadurai and Alexander do acknowledge that, in the contexts of digital
and financial systems specifically, acts of failing have an impact on
today’s user or consumer subject who gets positioned as ‘a perennial
tester, a reporter on failures’.[^20Nanna_14]

Acts of failure are temporary defeats or final failures that
nevertheless perform in unexpected ways. Returning to such acts
(‘glitches’) in digital systems, writer and curator Legacy Russell
argues:

> Herein lies a paradox: glitch moves, but glitch also blocks. It
> incites movement while simultaneously creating an obstacle. Glitch
> prompts and glitch prevents. With this, glitch becomes a catalyst,
> opening up new pathways, allowing us to seize on new directions
> \[...\] glitch is something that extends beyond the most literal
> technological mechanics: it helps us to celebrate failure as a
> generative force, a new way to take on the world.[^20Nanna_15]

What Russell demonstrates here is that in acts of failing on the
internet, for instance, oppressive regimes of power go hand in hand with
positive identity transformations. Acts of failing must be analyzed as
such: symmetrically between oppression and transformation. And the
paradoxes can be mobilized for activist art and other projects that work
toward designing for social and ecological change. In *The Queer Art of
Failure*, queer theorist Jack Halberstam demonstrates that mundane
happenings in everyday (queer) life can have the same potential,
provided that we leave the binary between successful and failed life
behind, a binary that heteronormative, capitalist societies want us to
use as a yardstick in evaluating the lives of ourselves and others. With
financial markets collapsing and divorce rates skyrocketing, Halberstam
demonstrates that we must change our measures of success in order to be
able to see ‘more creative, more cooperative, more surprising ways of
being in the world’.[^20Nanna_16]

What, then, could be a ‘final failure’?

What would it mean for a failure to be even more than a temporary
research, artistic, or design result that deserves publication or
installation so as to do justice to the science as it was practiced in
the past, just so that present-day and future researchers and
‘researchers of research’ or ‘researchers of making’ can make good use
of it on empirical, anthropological, or foundational registers? Here,
indeed, the creative fields of arts and design come in. In design
contexts, for example, it is very well possible that a failure is final
or that, at least, it has more than temporary value and comes to be part
of the urban fabric. In their 2013 reflective essay ‘Final Draft:
Designing Architecture’s Endgame’, architects Gretchen Wilkins and
Andrew Burrows ask the following question: ‘Isn’t keeping things
unfinished the most open and the best way of getting things done?’[^20Nanna_17]
The answer to their own question: ‘\[...\] this all depends on what is
meant by “done”, and the reasons to stay undone are changing’.[^20Nanna_18]

In their essay, ‘final draft’ is a concept. This concept allows us to
think of ‘done’ and ‘undone’ as the two sides of one and the same coin.
The concept introduces the possibility of working in an out-of-control
key: is multi-directional ‘drafting’ the primary process that
‘completion’ necessarily reduces to univocality and unambiguousness? In
order not to reduce, Wilkins and Burrows stay with drafting, so that
even a completed product remains ‘open.’ Why do they go through such
pains? Because they have the goal of persistently stimulating innovation
(in design), creation (in art), and creativity (across all cultural
domains at once (and for all)). This brings us back to the impetus of
the *Journal of Trial & Error*; a journal that situates itself right in
the middle of the making of scientific truths as well as untruths that
have truth-value in that they rule out certain things that once had
great potential.

The non-reductive and complex work of Wilkins and Burrows affirms that
every creative product, scholarly or design — their text, this short
chapter, this collection, their architectural projects, *all*
architecture even when it has won some important prizes — is a final
draft. They conceptualize that final drafts are, firstly, material. They
consist of raw or movable material; they are located in, and as, places
that allow for many things to happen there. Secondly, final drafts are
representational. They will have to be finished, one day, or they will
have to be interpreted academically or aesthetically. It is possible for
people not to come to an agreement on the meaning — historically,
aesthetically, communally, etc. — of such unfinished objects or places.
Thirdly, final drafts are material-discursive projects.[^20Nanna_19] Examples
are functional designs that are looking for a function, or open-source
software requesting to be adopted for use. In other words, final drafts
are ‘creatively incomplete’.[^20Nanna_20] And remember, pushing Latour to the
extreme, for Wilkins and Burrows, *all* objects, text, images, and
places are creatively incomplete projects!

Whereas the two architects take an ontological standpoint about the
unfixity of the seemingly fixed, they also have an eye for how final
drafts are developed in practice. They affirm that in collaborative
(and) design processes, we can differentiate two paradoxical movements
or forces.[^20Nanna_21] On the one hand, there is the process that hopefully
leads to the bringing about of meaning. This is a process that abounds
in ambiguity and is fundamentally conversational. On the other hand,
Wilkins and Burrows acknowledge that collaborative (and) design
processes are intended to come to a conclusion, a model, or a plan. As
such, the processes are fraught with ambition and the urge to control.
In our times of economical, ecological, and social crises, it is all the
more important to embrace the inherent tensions in the design process as
a *project*.

Ultimately, they suggest for us to ‘do as Detroit’, which is to say:
‘assert \[your\] “draft” state as “final” in order to perpetuate
continued innovation’.[^20Nanna_22] They suggest for us to try to search for the
unfinished, even in seemingly finished contexts, so as to be able to
constantly mobilize the ‘frays’ for innovation, creation, creativity,
and, eventually, change. Wholly in line with *JOTE*, they want us to
embrace an attitude of ‘construction-as-research’.[^20Nanna_23]
