# Sniffs of Failure: Discomfort, Unease and Serendipity in Sensory Communication Design 

### Kate McLean

## Introduction

In 2018 I was I was invited to run an event to demonstrate the potential
of smell in storytelling. I proposed a series of participant smellwalks,
and subsequent mapping, to encourage the inclusion of smells in the
stories we tell and share. My design-led practice of smellscape mapping
requests participants to work through their own fear of failure in their
capacity to detect and describe smells. Retrospectively I can count
numerous points of failure and will highlight three that stand out in
this chapter: i) failure to be able to smell (anosmia), ii) failure to
record meaning associated with participant-drawn symbols (researcher
oversight), and a iii) serendipitous failure in weather (rain). I will
also allude to some advantages of regarding failure as an integral part
of the design process. My specialist field, sensory communication
design, is nascent[^28Kate_1]. My research into communication of olfactory
perception using a range of visualization techniques and mappings has
been queried and challenged since ‘Smellmap Edinburgh’ exhibited in at
the *International Edinburgh Science Festival* in 2011.[^28Kate_2] While the
history of mapping smells dates to the 1700s to track trajectories of
disease and industrial emissions, there remains an overarching critique
of representing smells due to their ephemerality.[^28Kate_3]

From this perspective there are more reasons to not map smells than
there are to do so: smells cannot be seen and therefore cannot be
verified; smells are subjective and cannot be validated; smells are
ephemeral and cannot be pinpointed; smells do not have defined area of
existence or static boundaries; smells do not exist — except as
collections of airborne molecules — until humans differentiate them;
physiological processes such as habituation and adaptation[^28Kate_4] affect
human capacity to detect smells; humans are inconsistent at identifying
smells.

Despite the series of objections, there is precedent for mapping smells
in place from fields such as odor monitoring, public health, and
olfactory art dating back to the 1700s in Europe and the USA.[^28Kate_5]
Interestingly, historical smell maps point to failures of urban
industrial planning to take account of odors in factories as the
highlight sites where the emissions impact. Recent creative approaches
to sensory communication design embrace and collate numerous variables
to engage meaningful dialogue about smells, and the human capacity to
detect, differentiate, and describe them.

## Failure in Design

While dictionary definitions of failure posit it as the opposite of
success — anywhere on a sliding scale between a flop and a disaster,
pertaining to both quantity and quality — failure is integral to the
design process. This is especially relevant to smell mapping as design
that seeks to render visible a frequently overlooked and invisible to
the eye sensory way of knowing. Rothbucher and Rothbucher[^28Kate_6] explain
that prior to defining failure, it is first necessary to consider
design’s function. To design something (or to actively change it) is
based on a premise that the original artefact or practice is in some way
lacking. Thus, failure is regarded as the initial starting point for a
brief for the ‘problem solver’ designer. In smell mapping, the initial
starting point is smells’ failure to be noticed, its invisibility.

In addition to failure as a starting point for design, failure is also
integral to the design process whose goal according to Friedman is to
‘change existing situations into preferred ones’.[^28Kate_7] The design process
includes scope for failure and a desire to learn from that failure;
in-built is the concept of ‘iteration’,[^28Kate_8] in which multiple versions
of a design can be tested and compared with each other prior to
selecting and re-developing a final optimal version. Smell mapping, as a
nascent field, undergoes methodological changes and design
decision-making in every new smell mapping project as each site,
participant group, and project outcome differs and requires constant,
rapid iteration. From a digital perspective, the Interaction Design
Foundation (an educational network advocating user experience (UX)
design) suggests design failures are ‘solutions that are outlandish or
impractical’; with three potential points of failure: i) user interface
design, ii) information architecture design, and iii)
adoption/acceptance by the target audience.[^28Kate_9]

The godfather of UX Don Norman writes how ‘we need to remove the word
failure from our vocabulary, replacing it with learning experience. To
fail is to learn: we learn more from our failures than our
successes’.[^28Kate_10] The process of mapping smells connects with UX in that
it has an interface (albeit non-digital) and requires adoption on the
part of the target audience. In requesting participants to contribute to
a map of smells, a situation of fear of failure often changes into a new
one of self-belief (in the capacity to describe smells without
specialist terminology) and advance individual knowledge (about the
smells that make up everyday lives). Such an acceptance of a ‘new’
interface (the olfactory system and its subsequent processing) is
achieved through clear direction and guidance. In this case, the
interface has three layers: sniffing and encountering smells directly,
interpreting smells into language descriptions, and translating the
descriptions into visual symbols that have both color and form. It
requires courage to set aside insecurities and sniff potentially
disgusting objects and places. Participants frequently worry that they
might fail to smell anything at all. To mitigate this, every smellwalk
is scaffolded by encouraging olfactory success by sharing smell
encounters at regular 15-minute intervals. This reduces the fear of
failure as participants become confident in their detection and
description capabilities and feel empowered to sniff closer to new
objects.

On a positive note, smell communication has no rule book, and rarely
does Western schooling teach either descriptive or visual vocabularies.
We have extremely limited prior reference for the representation of
smell in either color or shape. And, as Kessler suggests, ‘If you don’t
know the rules, you don’t know not to break them’.[^28Kate_11] Without prior
art and rules, smellwalkers are liberated to do as they please, although
I have noted on some occasions that a lack of prior art can equally
paralyse some participants.

## Making Meaning Through Storytelling

The questions as to how storytelling might be augmented for future
generations was tackled annually (prior to 2019) by a festival known as
the Future of Storytelling (FoST).[^28Kate_12] Over three days in September
2017, this took place at Snug Harbor on Staten Island, New York.[^28Kate_13]
FoST’s goal is to change the way stories are told using immersive,
interactive, and cutting-edge technological approaches. Most of the
commissioned events blend digital and physical worlds; mansion rooms are
given over to virtual reality experiences, in the 83-acre park marquees
contain mixed reality experiences blending hologram and human
interaction, the gardens host theatrical performances in which a
foam-filled bathtub is the stage. FoST invites attendees to discover a
range of dissemination practices; in a digital age oral traditions can
be augmented by both technologies and the under-used senses. While the
story might be timeless, the method of delivery alters.

## Failure to Smell

To collect data for the smell map, FoST created a sign-up list of
participants for seven smellwalks over three days with a maximum of 15
people per walk. A smellwalk is a sensewalk[^28Kate_14] during which the
primary mode of information encountered is deliberately switched from
visual to olfactory and comprises of three sections with strategies for
sniffing and recording the odors encountered; smell-catching,
smell-hunting (see Figure 20.1), and free-smelling.[^28Kate_15] In each
section, participants are asked to record up to four smells. A group
discussion punctuates each section, encouraging the sharing of smells
and conversation about similar encounters, smell associations, general
queries, and a chance to unpack the new experience.

Common concerns and questions at the start of every smellwalk focus on
individual inability to smell (having a poor sense of smell) and not
being able to name smells correctly. Human olfactory dysfunction is
assessed to affect 3-22% of the population,[^28Kate_16] with a range of
dysfunction from complete inability to smell to slight impairment. The
aging process has an impact on smell detection,[^28Kate_17] which means I scan
each smellwalk group carefully and note who might need greater
encouragement. Concerns over potential failure to identify smells, which
in the Western world is poor compared to other cultures and
languages,[^28Kate_18] I allay by explaining the purpose of the walk is to
‘name’ smells, rather than ‘identify’ them, and give examples from
previous smell names such as the ‘shattered dreams’[^28Kate_19] and ‘a hard
life’[^28Kate_20] from previous projects. Smell naming through description
removes failure, drawing instead on participants’ lived experience.

During one of the FoST smellwalks, a participant stopped during the
smell-hunting (second) section of the walk, and when I enquired as to
why, he replied that he was devastated to discover that his sense of
smell was almost non-existent and that he needed to process what this
meant to him. Anosmia, ‘the absence of a sense of smell’,[^28Kate_21] is rare.
In 2017 just 3% of Americans had either no sense of smell or an
extremely limited sense of smell.[^28Kate_22] Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
smell loss was most often seen as an indicator of aging, or as an early
warning for neurogenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s disease,[^28Kate_23] or an unfortunate result of an accident or
infection. The effects of such a discovery during a pleasurable weekend
meant that the participant decided it would be better for him to step
away from the activity, seek medical advice after the weekend, and
contact specialist smell disorder support groups Fifth Sense and
AbScent[^28Kate_24] for further information. The experience brought the ethics
of the smellwalk to the fore and the requirement for great sensitivity
in responding to physical participation in the creation of new work. A
failure to be able to smell has repercussions for inclusivity and
equality of experience in smell mapping projects. In 2015 Fifth Sense
conference attendees participated in a smellwalk and were paired with
‘smell buddies’ who described the aromas encountered.

## Failure to Record

My concept for the smellmap was ‘ephemerality’, to match the fleeting
nature of smell perception and the limited time span. I created a
three-metre square base map of the site of Snug Harbor on Staten Island
on the tarmac in the grounds using wax crayons from a gridded plan to
indicate the roads, buildings, and the ocean (see Figure 20.2).

The smellwalk participants were invited to the ‘crayon ground map’ and
given an opportunity to collaborate/co-create and select from a choice
of colored chalk crayons to communicate a single geolocated smell from
their smellwalk. In addition to enabling the participants to consider
how to communicate their smell experience visually, the reaction to the
symbols were intriguing to me as a researcher. Without any precedent of
a visual language for smell, a freedom in the audience responses veered
in two directions; for some there was a freedom to draw anything, for
others there was a paralysis. As the map filled with symbols the
participants had a chance to see previous examples and could respond
accordingly. The visual symbols largely represented the source of the
smell; bathroom, watermelon, books, boxing gloves (see Figure 20.3),
meat, an insect, a section of rope, the schoolhouse. Some participants,
however, failed to record their smells. The failure to record lessened
as time went on, and the stories associated with the graphics prompted
imaginative leaps to enable visualization of smells as individual
experiences.

Other visuals represented a personal discover: ‘I smelled inside four
bins and they all smelled different’ (see Figure 20.4). The rainbow that
alludes to the range of smells encountered in a single sniff and also
calls out the insufficiencies in language to describe smells adequately
(see Figure 20.5). One visual, a Christmas tree, was representative of a
fruit that had fallen to the ground and smelled of spices and nutmeg.

single sniff visualized as a rainbow, 2017. Photo credit: Kate McLean.

In total, 35 smell visuals were added to the map, but I failed to record
50% of the contributors smell graphic explanations. Reasons for my
failure can be attributed to hosting a live event; at times I was in
conversation with participants about their experiences, or finding
materials, or answering questions, or encouraging and teasing out
potential visuals, or organising and preparing for the next walk. The
result of my omission is somewhere between a challenge (to guess as to
the visual olfactory representation) and frustration (in trying to
decipher a green blob). To summarize, the failure to record the meaning
attributed to each smell was a researcher oversight which resulted in
fewer smell stories; a goal of the project.

## When a Conceptual Fail Becomes Reality

My concept for the Staten Island smellmap was ephemerality; I was
interested in how far I might push the metaphor for smell molecules as
they disperse in air to a low concentration that the human nose can no
longer detect. Everyday experiences of smells in open environments are
perceived as ephemeral as the smells are sniffable and present one
moment but the next moment they are gone.

In previous work I had used watercolour paints, which diffuse at the
edges as paint particles are diluted by water. I looked to street art
practices[^28Kate_25] for inspiration as to how the Staten Island smellmap
might gradually dissolve and disappear, leaving no permanent record, and
decided on chalk-art, which ‘eventually blurs and washes away’.[^28Kate_26]
Perversely, it would be a failure if the map left a permanent trace.
Pavement chalks are large crayons of soft colored chalk, pliable, easy
to smudge, and easily erased with a drop of water. As an artist I wanted
to leave no trace, as a researcher and designer I decided to photograph
the map at the end of each day as a record of its existence. At the end
of each day I took a series of photos that could be digitally stitched
together (see Figure 20.6) to create pictures of the map as it evolved.

I planned for the map to dissolve following the first rains after the
final day of FoST. I awoke on the final day of the event to an overcast
sky and puddles on the sidewalks. I hurried to the site. The basemap
remained, but every chalk drawing of a smell visual had disappeared. I
had made a monumental mistake in not covering the work with a tarpaulin.
The smells had all disappeared, exactly as anticipated, except a full 24
hours before the Staten Island smellmap was complete.

## Conclusion

The entire project was littered with additional micro-failures of time
management, of leaves on the artwork, of distraction. As a designer, I
assess what I would do differently next time to mitigate against such
risks; as an artist I value how these made the project and the resulting
stories surrounding its manifestation more poignant, intriguing, and
memorable. Sensory communication design draws from both design and art’s
relationships with failure; pragmatic organization and structuring (from
design) and an openness to doubt and serendipity (from art).

As a hybrid of performance, design, and art, *Smellmap Staten Island*
demonstrated that any newly discovered malfunction of human body during
research requires sensitivity and background knowledge to signal
supportive resources on the part of the researcher. A lack of existing
canon for smell communication can be both liberating and intimidating
for participants. When it comes to drawing personal smell perceptions we
have no rules, we have never learned, we can only trust ourselves to
interpret what we experience. An awareness of this means it is essential
for the researcher to be supportive and to construct a framework for
such an exploration.

This project was the first time I deployed a street art approach to the
communication of smell, and while it is limited in the colour range, it
has potential to uncover symbolic associative links that participants
make, and the stories that emerge from communicating a smell. This is
worthy of further research, and I can draw on this work to generate
similar spontaneous and agile outdoor projects. Recording the intent
behind the drawings was an oversight, and next time I would be sure to
note these down at the time of their creation. The simultaneous joy and
sadness I experienced when discovering an empty map on the morning of
the final day of FoST manifested as a more enjoyable set of smellwalks
with less pressure to complete the map and more time to engage fully
with the participants.

Failure is important to the creative process, whether deliberate through
an iterative design process or through being able to see the benefits
that arise from errors. It is an essential part of a researcher’s
reflexive journey.
