# On the Joys of Administration: Or Race, Failure and the Neoliberal Academy

### Olivia Khoo

In Australian academia — where diversity hiring and affirmative action
has not (yet) been institutionalized — the visibility of ‘race’ in the
academy has been all but completely erased, transmuted onto the student
body as a ‘problem’ of international students. While student diversity
is hypervisible in marketing brochures — reflecting a rapidly changing
student population — academic culture has been much slower to change.
For more than six years since my hire in 2010, I was the only non-white,
full-time female academic in my school.[^21Olivia_1] I have been told by a
colleague that I am a ‘triple threat’ — Asian, female, and queer — as
though I have surely sung, danced, and acted my way into a reasonably
successful mid-career.

This opening paragraph may read like a complaint, and it both is — in
Sara Ahmed’s terms[^21Olivia_2] — and isn’t. It is also a meditation on academic
performance and ‘productivity’ in mid-career. In the last several years
I have taken on more administrative roles in the university — from
directing research centres and the school’s postgraduate program to more
mundane forms of administration: replying to ever growing mountains of
email, editing other people’s work, and filling in endless bureaucratic
forms.

I have been reflecting upon the consequences of this ‘retreat’ into
administration in terms of the roles available for senior women in the
neoliberal university. The thing is, I am *great* at administration: I
have an eye for detail and I am organized and efficient with my time.
Administration, I find, is soothing — a way of clearing out junk. It
provides a semblance of structure and productivity when time for
research is scarce. Ann Cvetkovich writes:

> Academics too often struggle with long-term projects such as
> dissertations and books while squeezed on the one hand by an intensely
> competitive job market and meritocratic promotion and reward system
> and driven on the other by a commitment to social justice that often
> leaves us feeling like we’re never doing enough to make a
> difference.[^21Olivia_3]

Hence the joy of administration, an immediate sense of accomplishment
*that meets the needs of others*. However, the ‘joy of administration’ —
as I call it — also belies a loss of confidence, particularly in my
direction as a researcher and educator in mid-career. I don’t want to
*lean in*, I want to disappear into emails, into administration, into
details. A question I often ask myself is: is administrative work
unproductive, or worse: counterproductive to teaching and research? Or
is it a necessary part of both? The answer probably lies somewhere in
between: if one is buried in administration, it becomes impossible to do
much else, but the academy cannot function without the distribution of
administrative tasks among academics.

As to who is doing the bulk of this work, in *Counterproductive*,
Melissa Gregg writes that much of the history of productivity is
gendered: ‘Pioneering productivity studies focused on the repetitive
manual labor of young, often migrant workers, many of whom were poor
women. Assumptions typical of the era established class, gender, and
ethnic biases that continue in management theory and practice
today’.[^21Olivia_4] As with other organizations and institutions, universities
are increasingly obsessed with measuring productivity, marked by a shift
from a focus on numerical indicators (citations), to a discourse of
‘engagement and impact’. In the arts and humanities, where I work, these
indicators are also complemented by ‘altmetrics’ (alternative metrics,
or non-traditional bibliometrics), which are captured by a variety of
sources, most notably by the eponymous website *Altmetrics*.[^21Olivia_5]
*Altmetrics* promises to ‘discover the attention surrounding your
research’ and present this in a ‘single visually engaging and
informative view of the online activity surrounding your scholarly
content’, represented in the form of a rainbow ‘donut’ (this food-based
imagery and terminology is the company’s). This donut data does not
offer insight into the conditions that enable or hinder productivity in
the workplace, including institutional structures of gender and race.
Yet within the existing neoliberal framework, it is a form of failure to
not be motivated by a drive towards productivity. And as an Asian female
academic, failure is not really an option.

Eleanor Ty’s book *AsianFail: Narratives of Disenchantment and the Model
Minority*, offers a humorous and critical commentary on the stereotypes
linking Asians to productivity and success. She discusses the
\#AsianFail and \#failasian hashtags on Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter,
which feature pictures and anecdotes of Asians who ‘fail’ at doing
things Asians are meant to be good at, like maths, playing the violin,
and using chopsticks.[^21Olivia_6] As an Asian who has ‘failed’ at many (of
these) things, most spectacularly at keeping a same-sex marriage alive,
I have returned to queer theory, to find solace in how negative affects
can also create new forms of sociality and affiliation. In *The Queer
Art of Failure*, Jack Halberstam points out that ‘success in a
heteronormative, capitalist society equates too easily to specific forms
of reproductive maturity combined with wealth accumulation’.[^21Olivia_7]
Halberstam suggests looking again at failure, which ‘allows us to escape
the punishing norms that discipline behaviour’.[^21Olivia_8] Is being ‘good’ at
administration a form of failure in the academy for female researchers,
particularly given the gendered history of female productivity? Or, as
Gregg[^21Olivia_9] questions, is productivity even the right measure for work at
all?

As a senior female administrator, a significant part of my role involves
emotional labour and the management of ‘emotion work’. As Arlie Russell
Hochschild[^21Olivia_10] has famously argued, the management of emotional labour
falls predominantly to women. In the context of the academy, which has
become increasingly corporatized, we are told to work in the service of
our ‘clients’ (formerly known as ‘students’). The corporate agenda
permeates all levels of teaching, from undergraduate to postgraduate,
and the voices that publicly rally against the facelessness of the
current system are few. Raewyn Connell has offered an alternative vision
of higher education in her book *The Good University*, and in her
earlier writings on postgraduate supervision as the long-term
negotiation of a human relationship, with all its ups and downs, rather
than an activity that follows a prescriptive formula.[^21Olivia_11] We do need to
keep some of our more difficult feelings in check in this relationship,
but this does not mean subscribing to a lifetime of bondage in what
Angela McRobbie refers to as ‘the smile economy in the teaching
machine’.[^21Olivia_12]

McRobbie writes:

> The smile economy in the classroom translates into a kind of measured
> self-management style of pedagogy, one which is constantly alert to

> are based on almost day-to-day performance factors. \[…\] \[The\]

> femininity were also quietly encoded within the academic version of
> ‘customer care’.[^21Olivia_13]

The containment of less ‘seemly’ emotions — anger, frustration, disgust
— is bound up in a culture of self-regulation that is distinctly
gendered female within the neoliberal discourse. Rosalind Gill and Shani
Orgad detail the growing cult(ure) of confidence that permeates all
aspects of women’s work and social life. The suggestion is that ‘both
the causes and solutions of confidence culture lie in women —
individually, as opposed to collectively’ yet is inclusive of every
woman regardless of race, class, sexuality, or age.[^21Olivia_14] The implication
is that environmental and structural factors need not change but women
themselves must aspire towards greater confidence and success — not by
accepting failure but by ‘thinking positively.’[^21Olivia_15]

Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful for the opportunities that my
university has afforded me in developing my leadership skills. However,
the rhetoric of leadership ‘training’ needs to change. I have been
invited to participate in a series of leadership workshops with titles
including: the Strategic Leader, Crafting Your Leadership Presence,
Master Storytelling, Courageous Conversations, and Strategic Resilience.
That the words ‘strategy’ and ‘mastery’ appear in several of these
titles is not without significance. The word ‘strategy’ has roots in
military theory (from the Greek *stratēgos*, *stratos* ‘army’ + *agein*
‘to lead’).

Against whom am I leading an army as I rise in the ranks of academia?
The blurb for the Strategic Resilience workshop states ‘Building your
strategic resilience is not just about capably responding to a crisis or
rebounding from a setback. It’s about cultivating your ability to
respond and adapt to ongoing change.’ Sadly, *ongoing* change is a
reality in most higher education institutions, and the expectation of
individual cultivation of adaptive responses (including admonishments
against overly ‘emotional’ responses) is arguably gendered. As Gill and
Akane Kanai note, ‘women must become ever more adept at fielding new
affective obligations’[^21Olivia_16] as corporate structures continue to shift
under our feet.

I am of course reminded of Michel de Certeau’s famed distinction between
strategies and tactics involved in the resistance to power. Strategies
are a function of place, involving institutions and structures of
power.[^21Olivia_17] By contrast, ‘a *tactic* is a calculation determined by the
absence of a proper locus \[…\] The space of the tactic is the space of
the other’.[^21Olivia_18] As Ian Buchanan notes:

> the essential difference between the two is the way they relate to the
> variables that everyday life inevitably throws at us all. Strategy
> works to limit the sheer number of variables affecting us by creating
> some kind of protected zone, a place in which the environment can be
> rendered predictable if not properly tame. \[…\] Tactics, by contrast,
> is the approach one takes to everyday life when one is unable to take
> measures against its variables.[^21Olivia_19]

Strategic resilience, then, seems to imply that one should be selective
about the kinds of challenges one will make against the university, to
be ‘battle ready’ by smiling, adapting, and being conciliatory towards a
higher leadership. Strategic resilience advocates self-monitoring over
resistance, personal adaptation over political or structural
change.[^21Olivia_20] With so few women (of colour) in leadership positions, the
imperative to play the game becomes even higher. Perhaps then it is
useful to view failure as a call to collective action; a tactic that has
its place in the many ways we negotiate academic work and practice
resilience.

The term ‘academic feminism’ has been used to describe the ‘historical
project of challenging the university by institutionalizing new
knowledge formations’.[^21Olivia_21] Yet as Robyn Wiegman notes, ‘to conjoin
academic to feminism today is almost always a distinct insult, an
accusation that draws its blood precisely because politics and academics
have come to be so firmly opposed’.[^21Olivia_22] Academic feminists such as
Judith Butler have been criticized for ‘luxuriating in theoretical
pleasure and thereby abandoning practical politics’.[^21Olivia_23] Wiegman
analyses the failure of academic feminism and notes that the ‘problem’
for academic feminism is that it has institutional power.[^21Olivia_24] She
continues:

> Failure, it seems to me, is the unavoidable consequence of imagining
> political transformation, especially in the context of the
> differentials that collate around investments in institutions, social
> practices, and various kinds of critical agencies and projects.[^21Olivia_25]

I, too, embrace the feminist use of the idiom of failure in the context
of academia, failure in a more tactical sense. As ‘Women’s Studies’ and
‘Gender Studies’ programs have been decimated across Australian higher
education institutions, only to be tentatively re-launched with the
resurgent success of academic feminism, the lessons of various forms of
institutional ‘failure’ are surely that we must find new ways to be in
the academy, new forms of *emoting* (of smiling and meaning it, and
being emotional (if we want)). The academy may be a strategic
institution but with real feminist struggles that need to be tackled
through theory *and* practice.

It is important to consider (and collate) personal stories of success
and failure in the neoliberal academy (however we measure these) and the
institutional struggles women have faced to arrive (or end up) in these
positions, and to make these stories more visible. This is a form of
administration, but one that I feel is worthwhile. Sara Ahmed refers to
the ‘snap’, which can be sudden, or ‘the gradual sapping of energy when
you have to struggle to exist in a world that negates your
existence.’[^21Olivia_26] While I have certainly considered resigning in feminist
protest — like Sara Ahmed and Marina Warner so boldly did[^21Olivia_27] — I have
more recently begun thinking about alternatives, of how to harness the
power of exhausted women, women who fail, who have snapped, who are
fragile, who are shattered.

In Australia, where ‘institutional diversity’ barely goes beyond a
numbers game — women stacked up against men in graphs and tables and in
committee meetings — it is important to remain mindful of the hidden
nature of racism, of the lack of attention paid to sexuality, and to
call for specific and localized forms of feminist intervention where
necessary, without always defaulting to a generalized
‘intersectionalist’ approach that may not be able to cover it all. I am
often asked by international students if I am Chinese. They seek a
particular, embodied form of connection through a shared ethnicity. I
have been reflecting on my role in how to make a difference through my
various forms of difference.

Institutionalizing the ‘work’ of diversity may not be the path for
Australia, but it is important that we start by looking at the messy,
ugly affects that arise from unacknowledged forms of diversity work in
the academy. Alison Jaggar writes that ‘emotions play a vital role in
developing knowledge’.[^21Olivia_28] I would like us to think about this
statement broadly, as a way of harnessing sensitive emotions to our
collective academic pursuits, and in the service of the often neglected
yet important task of administering tactical and localized change. Might
we think of failure as a tactic of new knowledge formation, embodying
emotional resilience, and providing opportunities for us to imagine new
ways of ‘doing’ the university differently outside of the
institutionalized mandate to continually succeed and be productive?
