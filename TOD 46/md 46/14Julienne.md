Figure 9.1: Participant C’s map of their domestic space while working
and caring from home.

Recent research indicates that parents and carers were interrupted up to
15 times per hour while working and caring from home (WCFH) during the
COVID-19 pandemic.[^14Julienne_1] In this chapter, we explore the relationship
between interruption and senses of failure as experienced by 22 creative
practice researchers in the context of WCFH between March 2020 and
October 2021 in and around Melbourne, Australia. We ask: what affective
impact has the intensification of ‘work’s intimacy’[^14Julienne_2] had on creative
industries researchers working and caring from home during the intense
‘lockdown’ phases of the COVID-19 pandemic? How have constant
interruptions affected their capacity to maintain continuity in their
intellectual and creative work? Further, how have the senses of failure
widely reported by those WCFH been articulated and expressed through
creative methods?

We use the phrase ‘work’s intimacy’ in the sense employed by media
studies scholar Melissa Gregg to describe and ‘demonstrate the
increasingly intimate relationship salaried professionals have with
their work’ and in particular the role of new media technologies in that
development.[^14Julienne_3]

Our chapter begins with a concise overview of recent literature on
failure and interruption during the time of COVID-19. We then provide a
brief outline of the methodology and methods we have employed to address
our key questions in this study. We consider the domestic as a space
interrupted under the pressure of work’s intimacy during periods of
WCFH. Through discussion and analysis of data collected through the
Work, Care and Creativity Study[^14Julienne_4] we explore perceptions of failure
among participants with a focus on how these perceptions relate to real
and perceived interruptions to their careers and creative work. Finally,
we discuss adaptation and adaptiveness, exploring the possibilities for
an affirmative political reading of failure and interruption.

## Failure and Interruption

There have been mixed debates about the impact of working and caring
from home. For some creative workers it was ‘a surprisingly creative
time’,[^14Julienne_5] but for many it was a difficult and debilitating phase of
work and family life. Australian research published since the arrival of
the pandemic has shown that women ‘continued to shoulder the burden of
unpaid domestic and caring work’[^14Julienne_6], raising concerns about a
significant worsening of existing inequalities in the workforce. The
negative impact on women in academia has been notable, with many studies
confirming reduced productivity[^14Julienne_7] and a negative impact on career
momentum.[^14Julienne_8] Further, workers in the arts and creative industries were
particularly vulnerable to career disruption during COVID-19, and this
was especially so in Melbourne, Australia, where our project
participants were based, and where lockdown conditions were among the
world’s most restrictive.[^14Julienne_9]

While precarity in the arts and higher education sectors in Australia
pre-dated the pandemic[^14Julienne_10] and working parents and carers are not new
to career disruption, the pandemic enabled a perfect storm. The
intensification of work’s intimacy kept prescient the feeling that these
‘new’ conditions may have no end.[^14Julienne_11] Among the 22 participants in our
study, WCFH led to increased anxieties about failure, sparked in large
part by the perception that focus of any kind for an extended period was
no longer possible. Lived experience, for those WCFH during COVID-19,
was life perpetually interrupted.

Large scale studies conducted prior to COVID-19 found that constant
interruption was a key source of stress at work[^14Julienne_12] and that knowledge
workers are interrupted on average 85 times per day.[^14Julienne_13] Related
international studies have indicated that frequent interruptions have a
negative impact on emotions, wellbeing, and performance[^14Julienne_14]. The
constant interruption while WCFH during the pandemic was cited
consistently among our participants as a source of stress and anxiety
about the future.

For psychosocial theorist Lisa Baraitser, interruption is not a
deviation but the norm for the maternal subject.[^14Julienne_15] Similarly, gender
and equality studies scholar Moynag Sullivan observes that creative work
that engages with an aesthetics of interruption rethinks the
possibilities of subjective experience by ‘bear\[ing\] witness to the
fragmented, interrupted consciousness of the mother’.[^14Julienne_16] For scholar
and artist E.L. Putnam, an aesthetics of interruption encompasses an
ethics where ‘breaks, jagged edges, absences, silence and noise are not
glossed over through illusions of perfection but these qualities point
to the glut of experience and how it exceeds the limits of
representation.’[^14Julienne_17] Our study proposes that surfacing the affective
dimensions of these interruptions places value on the fragmented,
affective, and invisible aspects of care labor.

Building on Gregg’s notion of work’s intimacy, we propose that the
relational intensities of the pandemic created new forms of ‘intimacy
work’ where many people experienced an accelerated sense of failure
around the daily demands of life and labor, which significantly
disrupted creative and academic work. As queer and feminist theorists
have highlighted, the Western concept of failure is bound up in
capitalist value systems and binary thinking,[^14Julienne_18] which leads to
individualized conceptions of failure that don’t recognize how failure
is ‘institutionally contextualized and cooperatively understood’.[^14Julienne_19]
While we acknowledge that failure has ‘subversive potential’,[^14Julienne_20] we
also recognize that it is painfully experienced, particularly when
framed as an individual problem. Our work aims to surface the intangible
affects and residues that emerge from this sense of individual failure,
understanding that collective failure can make a productive contribution
to feminist subjectivity.

## Methodology and Methods 

During 2020 and 2021, we collaborated with digital ethnographers Larissa
Hjorth and Gretchen Coombs on the Work, Care and Creativity Study.[^14Julienne_21]
The aim was to understand the experiences of primary carers working from
home, specifically carers who were creative arts practitioners
associated with the university sector. We were interested in deploying
creative practice ethnography techniques to elicit participants’ lived
experiences of WCFH during the pandemic. These methods enabled our
participants to articulate often overlooked perceptions and experiences
through creative writing, drawing, and photography. The call was
circulated on social media through snowballing (contacts of contacts) in
early 2020. Twenty-two participants responded to creative prompts and we
followed up on their submissions with narrative interviews. This mixed
methods approach provided insights into the affective experience of
during the pandemic. Here, we draw on the creative prompts and the
interview material we collected in order to discuss and analyse senses
of failure and their relation to extended periods of constant
interruption.

In our study, many participants expressed a heightened sense of
precarity and fear about the future during their time WCFH. This was
likely exacerbated by the fact that project participants work in
industries that, in addition to being precarious, often demand
additional and invisible labor.[^14Julienne_22] An inability to perform this
additional labor disadvantages those with caring roles — a reality that
disproportionately impacts women and was exacerbated by the
pandemic.[^14Julienne_23] The sense of failure experienced by many working parents
and carers during COVID-19 brought these gender and caring inequities
into view.

Playful and modest forms of creative practice — in the form of brief
prompts — offered our participants the opportunity to express humor,
irony, and forms of feminist resistance that acknowledged failures small
and large by giving expression to competing subjectivities and tacit
labor under difficult conditions. Our lived experiences as creative
academics working and caring from home in the longest locked-down city
in the world[^14Julienne_24] influenced the framing and interpretation of our
research. This included bringing humor and care to the research process
and acknowledging our limits at a time of constant interruption. Modes
of humor that found expression through this project made possible a
shared recognition of collective fears and anxieties about the status
quo, particularly its potential to be maintained by patriarchal and
labor market forces. Shared career and parenting failures and a
heightened sense of irony around everyday failure, in this context,
became something our participants could draw on to create a sense of
hope for an affirmative politics.[^14Julienne_25]

## An Aesthetics of Interruption: The Spatial and Relational Intensities of the Home 

![](media/image2.jpg){width="3.577364391951006in"

Figure 9.2: Participant E’s response to ‘work/life balance’ while WCFH,
2020.

One of the creative prompts we produced asked for a description, sketch,
or photograph of the improvised home workspace during the height of
Melbourne’s COVID-19 lockdown. During this intensive phase, the space of
‘the office’ at home, often improvised and shot through with the noise
and movement of children, appeared in participant responses as a site
interrupted. One respondent, in her creative writing prompt, wrote, ‘my
office is a magic trick, an illusion.’ Figures 9.3 and 9.4 represent
additional responses to this same prompt.

> In the background of my ‘office’ — which cannot be shut to the rest of
> the house — is the noise of two seven-year-old girls. It is the last
> day of school holidays and I feel like a husk. They are supposed to be
> keeping quiet, but they are not. Some sort of argument is bubbling and
> so my ears are pricked up, my body coiled for intervention. 

Figure 9.3: Participant A’s response to our creative writing prompt
while WCFH, 2020.

> I have a door. I have a lock. But sound carries. There’s a big gap at
> the bottom of my door that my eldest slips notes under. They can’t
> write yet, but there’ll be letters and drawings. The gist of the notes
> is always: come out. Sometimes the notes are angry, with a picture of
> me at my desk with a cross through it. Sometimes the notes have love
> hearts, things that say I love you, I miss you. Sometimes they just
> yell at the door.

Figure 9.4: Participant B’s response to our creative writing prompt
while WCFH, 2020.

Those participants who responded to the prompt visually, as seen in
Figures 9.1 and 9.2, foregrounded forms of fragmentation, intensity, or
disruption that commonly accompany digital technologies. The cumulative
effect of constant and persistent trespasses at the edges of the
improvised ‘workspaces’ while WCFH is a noticeably negative impact on
the kinds of thinking or practices that could be performed there. Forms
of improvisation or ‘making do’ were also emphasized in the creative
prompts we collected, underlining a setting in which caring is also
present, such as the precariously balanced laptop in Figure 9.5, where
the presence of domestic chores lies somewhere just beyond view.

![](media/image3.png){width="4.171458880139983in"
height="2.7648042432195976in"}

Figure 9.5: Participant J’s workstation while WCFH, 2020.

Our research demonstrates that the confidence with which those WCFH can
‘hang on’ to their critical thinking skills or creative practice is
impacted by their WCFH circumstances. This also affects their hopes and
plans concerning career continuity, career development, and major
creative or intellectual work. As one participant expressed in her
interview:

> I think what is more difficult to communicate is, is the sense of, I
> could kind of tear up thinking about it, but I think it’s not even the
> mechanics of the idea that you’re going to be interrupted or that you
> might be interrupted. It’s what it actually kind of does for any deep
> work, which might be a relationship or yourself or a creative work or
> critical \[work\] or being responsive to another human in a work way,
> you know, any, any deep engagement I think becomes compromized.
> \[Participant Q, interview, 2020\]

In Figure 9.1, the scribbled ‘maps’ of the
improvised WCFH space offered to us by Participant C provide an
absurdist take on the working carer’s subjective experience of the
lockdown. There is no guidance in this map: meaning has broken down.
Overlapping lines of text could be the rough play squiggles of a child
who took hold of the pen in an act of defiance just at the wrong moment;
alternatively the lines may show the negative impact of interruption on
the carer’s emotional state.[^14Julienne_26] This is an instance of artwork that,
as Putnam observes, challenges our desire for coherence, giving us
instead ‘a sensory experiential phenomenology of co-being in which “the
forward thrust of our lives” is interfered with’.[^14Julienne_27] In this way, it
is also an instance of Sullivan’s aesthetics of interruption and
emblematic of the lived experiences of many participants in our study.
In follow up interviews, our participants
spoke at length about the problem of interruption. This flags a
deepening concern about how WCFH periods, still being experienced by
many of our participants as we finalize this chapter in 2022, will
impact their intellectual and creative work and their well-being into
the future.

## Perceptions of Failure

While some participants spoke about ‘frantically’ producing creative
work, or productively adapting to their limitations, others saw a
complete erasure of this part of their life. For some, the erosion of
time for academic and creative work was compounded by an internalized
and ubiquitous sense of failure:

> I totally failed at the PhD \[…\] I had no mental space, no emotional
> space, it just became this big black abyss, that I felt like every day
> went by, I was failing even further. \[Participant E, interview,
> 2020\]

And:

> I know I’ve failed at my creative work: I’ve not even attempted it
> once. \[Participant D, interview, 2020\]


As one participant remarked about the challenges of home schooling a
young child, ‘it was like having a baby again, I couldn't do anything.
Whilst I was with him, I couldn't do anything for myself’ \[Participant
J, interview, 2020\]. This feeling of *stuckness* relates to other
participant responses that detailed the frustration of living in the
fluidity and *unfixedness* of domestic space.

Figure 9.6 shows how Participant A perceived ‘accusing’ objects that sat
beyond the flimsy boundary of the screen; while in Figure 9.7
Participant F highlights the competing modes of co-presence within the
home by commenting on the aesthetic shifts caused by the pandemic.

> To the left of my desk sits the cat litter tray. To the right, the
> laundry basket is accusing me with laundry. Everywhere I look there
> are other things I have to do.

Figure 9.6: Participant A’s response to our creative writing prompt
while WCFH, 2020

> Each day there are new things in the hallway \[…\] I refrain from
> comment because I don’t care and I don’t want to discuss the pile —
> it’s like a social experiment except the pandemic is real and it
> brings stuff out of people’s bedroom and into the hallway.

Figure 9.7: Participant F’s response to our creative writing prompt
while WCFH, 2020

Other participants commented on the gendered tropes of domesticity and
childcare that bled into professional spaces. A number of them spoke
about the complexities of ‘opening’ their home to colleagues and
students. Participant R described how she arranged her Zoom background
to avoid any sign of domestic work or childcare stating that she didn’t
want people to ‘see what I'm doing or even associate me in my
professional life with domestic chores’ \[Participant R, interview,
2020\].

Humor helped participants to cope. Participant G’s response to our
creative prompt to write a set of instructions on how to get through the
day at home while balancing work and domestic and emotional labor is
presented in Figure 9.8.

> 1\. Login to the X as Y. Login to the Y as Z. Login to the E on behalf of

while WCFH, 2020.


## Collective Failures as Adaptation 

Our research uncovered several possibilities for adaptation and
transformation taken up by participants WCFH under COVID-19 lockdown
restrictions. Feminist humor and irony played an important role for many
of our participants, offering light relief and shared laughter under
pressure. Despite widespread perceptions of failure, a number of our
participants found that the consistent lockdowns in Melbourne also led
to new ways of making and doing. One participant said:

> I wrote differently, I wrote shorter pieces \[…\] I always have
> written \[…\] from conundrum and contradiction, from an idea or a
> problem that doesn’t make sense to me. But the thing about
> the beginning of the pandemic \[…\] was that we were riddled with the
> unknown. What did it mean? \[...\] What was it going to mean? I wrote
> frantically. (Participant F, interview, 2020)

One of our respondents, a long-term carer for a child with a disability,
observed a widespread cultural shift that meant many of the things she’d
been struggling with alone as someone regularly WCFH became mainstream:

> In COVID-times my son and I seem to be coping better with ‘social
> distancing’ and ‘isolation’ than many other people. We have been
> socially isolated most of the past twenty years. The difference now is
> that other people start to understand how limiting it is to have a
> life mainly spent at home in a hostile world. The difference now is
> that other people begin to experience the challenge of acute anxiety.
> The difference now is the general community has to recognize that life
> is contingent, health is temporary, and society matters. (Participant
> S, interview, 2020)

Here, one person’s experience of social failure due to structural and
cultural isolation becomes a shared phenomenon. Film and digital media
researcher Maud Ceuterick argues that while the pandemic has increased
the urgency with which gender inequalities need to be addressed, an
affirmative politics approach can allow us to see that ‘power relations
are not immutable, but rather are in constant transformation’.[^14Julienne_28]
Ceuterick sees the pandemic as providing an opportunity to make
structural inequalities more visible, suggesting that ‘the spatial
merging of the professional and domestic spheres opens up alternatives
to the status quo’.[^14Julienne_29]

## Conclusion 

While our participants often took a humorous or ironic approach in their
responses to creative prompts, the transcripts of our interviews reveal
a darker tone. In the confessional mode of the one-to-one interview,
humor and irony were less likely to be present. The pandemic exposed
that the gains of women in the arts and in academia were more tenuous
than they may have previously appeared. The collective exhaustion that
emerged from this recognition was also experienced as personal failure.
Our study found that despite knowledge that the problems of precarity
were structural rather than personal, the internalized niggle to take
responsibility for external circumstances remained.

As a feminist concept, collective failure resonates with notions of
queer failure; specifically, that the values that constitute ‘failure’
are often based on capitalist formations of identity that deny the
various forms of labor, insight, and value that parents and carers might
generate. We have used creative practice methods to attempt to surface
this sense of personal, professional, and creative failure that many
people experienced while WCFH. By highlighting senses of failure and
exhaustion through creative practice methods, we have considered what
these interruptions and failures might tell us about the subjectivity of
those WCFH. Rather than positioning these experiences as something to be
hidden, we propose that surfacing these dimensions places value on the
fragmented, affective, and invisible aspects of care labor, and as such,
has much to offer conceptions of feminist subjectivity.
