# Failurists: Methodologies, Motivations and Meanings

## Introduction: Locating Uncertain Futures

The idea of the Failurists Collective was born out of a creative methods
workshop at RMIT Europe in Barcelona in 2018. We were an
interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners interested in
how we could recalibrate the role of critical-creative methods in
relation to social justice and the climate emergency context. This
workshop was a window in time before the ‘unprecedented’ European
heatwaves, the catastrophic bushfires in North America and Australia and
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing our implicit culpabilities
and vulnerabilities, the sense of urgency to ‘do something’ creatively
and critically engage with this reality was palpable in the workshop.

The exercise was more than just a social innovation agenda. This
workshop was about stretching disciplines, techniques, methods, and
knowledge translation for new ways of knowing that allowed for
vulnerabilities and subjectivities to emerge as part of failing as an
act of liminality and deep reflection (see Figure 1.1). For example, the
way in which an ethnographer, if one listens deeply to the field, then
transforms the preconceived research questions through their failure. In
what ways could ‘pivoting’ be framed as an iteration in which codesign
and cocreation with the field is a constant process of failing,
translation, and recalibration?

Indeed, just the act of conversation between the disciplines is an
action of constant translation, failure, and adaptation — take, for
example, how elastic the term codesign has become across the disciplines
and sectors. For some it means ‘I spoke with an end-user’; for others it
is a constant cycle of discussion, debate, translation, and
transmission. As a collective, we explored various modalities of
workshopping — its potentialities and limits to create and curate
playful iteration and recalibration.

Since 2018, significant climate-related events in the world at large
have demonstrated that failure is ubiquitous within and across our human
systems. And, in turn, disenfranchised (unacknowledged) grief hangs
palpably like a heavy cloud, a distress now coined by Glenn Albrecht as
solastalgia – an ill feeling one experiences when they are powerless and
impacted by significant environmental changes and impacts.[^04SeriesIntroduction_1] David
Kessler, who with Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, explored the initial five
stages of grief, defined the COVID-19 pandemic as adding another layer
of grief — that of uncertain futures.[^04SeriesIntroduction_2]

However, for many, this uncertain future in a time of climate urgency
has been a long time coming. So much so that when we hear of heat waves
in London of 40 degrees Celsius and the heat dome in the Canadian town
of Lytton (which led to unprecedented temperatures of nearly 50 degrees
Celsius before a wildfire ignited and razed the community to the
ground), we know that it’s more than just a climate emergency. Climate
change has always been more of a communications and engagement crisis
than an environmental one.[^04SeriesIntroduction_3]

## The Unprecedented Precedent: Care, Worlding, and Different Ways of Doing

Artist and Milani Gallery.

Indigenous Australian Qunadamooka artist Megan Cope’s UNPRECEDENTED
(2020) is a wooden board sign in old English script. Made from ochre,
burnt Bundjalung country (charcoal), and glow mineral, the word
initially reads PRECEDENT. This work is a powerful statement on what has
now become precedent — unprecedented. With the increasingly climate
change-related natural disasters of fires, floods, and pandemics, the
word ‘unprecedented’ fails to capture the complex layers of material,
social, and environmental dimensions facing the globe. In the emptying
out of unprecedented to become precedent, it has become apparent that we
need to change how we do things. Indeed, in the face of such tremendous
failure, many have turned to the Indigenous ways of doing, being, and
knowing as a more sustainable way for the world in the face of
Anthropocentric disaster. How we work equitably with and alongside First
Peoples is of upmost priority in these critical unprecedented times,
recognizing that many contemporary concepts around sustainability, kin,
and futurisms draw from complex Indigenous cosmologies, which are
sometimes acknowledged but frequently not.

The failure of the Anthropocene — in which human-centeredness has led to
destruction of the environment — has meant that many are rethinking how
we relate to and ‘make’ the world, or what multispecies scholars call
our ‘worlding’. Worlding is a phenomenological concept which describes a
move away from divisions between subject and the environment to instead
focus on the *temporal,* *spatial,* and *corporeal relationality* of
being-in-the-world. Fundamental to this approach is how human-animal
relations figure in practices of caring — for ourselves, our others, and
the worlds we make.

For Donna Haraway, the failure of science and technology in exacerbating
rather than providing solutions to ecological destruction challenges us
to ‘radically rethink’ the relationship between humans and nature, and
dilate our sense of affinity, responsibility, and care to encompass
animals as co-evolutionary ‘kin’.[^04SeriesIntroduction_4] According to Gavin Van Horn et
al., we need to radically revise the relationality between humans and
more-than-humans in terms of kinship and kinning.[^04SeriesIntroduction_5] How might
multispecies theory contribute to media and cultural studies to enrich
our understanding of this kinship across social, digital, and material
worlds?

Care is a complex layering of affect that is often entangled with
practices of surveillance and guardianship, both social and
benevolent.[^04SeriesIntroduction_6] Over the last decade care has become an important space
and concept, particularly for feminist research by feminist scholars
including Annemarie Mol[^04SeriesIntroduction_7], Puig de la Bellacasa[^04SeriesIntroduction_8], and Haraway[^04SeriesIntroduction_9],
who directly explore care relationalities with emphases on media,
technologies, and more-than-human agency. As an historically ‘feminized’
concept, care has many dimensions and modes of affective labor and
pastoral guidance which have often been devalued. The COVID-19 pandemic
as a global phenomenon transgresses isolated geographies or
nation-states; it has centralized care as a matter of survival in
profoundly visible ways that has forced rich and powerful nations in the
Global North to bear witness to their own vulnerability and failures of
equitable care and governance.

Focus has turned to ideas like more-than-human kinship[^04SeriesIntroduction_10] as a way to
recalibrate how humans co-inhabit the world. More-than-human relations
have been the ongoing focus of several multispecies and animal studies
scholars including Haraway[^04SeriesIntroduction_11], Anne Galloway[^04SeriesIntroduction_12], Thom van
Dooren[^04SeriesIntroduction_13], and Eduardo Kohn[^04SeriesIntroduction_14] among many others. Their research
actively challenges human-centric approaches to ontology, agency,
design, and ethnographic research, providing alternative ways of
thinking about our being-in-the-world. So much so that now there is a
call for critical failure studies as a way to encompass and challenge
norms of success as part of neo-liberal regimes.[^04SeriesIntroduction_15]

In this way, failure is deeply embedded in our vulnerabilities. It is
intrinsic to how we learn, adapt, grow, and die. It emphasizes the need
to enhance our sensory experiences of the world and to acknowledge the
powerful role of smell, touch, and proprioception in our interpretations
of and feelings about the world. And while there has been a lot of
celebration of failure in entrepreneurial technology speak (‘fail bigger
and better’), at the core of failure is to be reflexive to the reality
of humanness. For some, failure is not just an experiment — they don’t
have the privilege or power. Scholars in feminist science and technology
studies (STS) and multispecies and environmental humanities have long
been fascinated by the role of failure in methodologies,
conceptualization, and ways of being in the world. It can help us
conceptualize concepts such as grief as not neo-liberal individuated
feelings but as part of a cultural fabric that helps us reflect and
learn from experience (rather than just repeating the same mistake again
and again).

## Failure as Creative Research Practice

Failure is a popular topic *of* research. It has long been a source of
study in fields such as sociology and anthropology, STS, privacy and
surveillance, cultural and media studies, art, theatre, film, and
political science. When things go awry, breakdown, or rupture they can
lead to valuable insights into the mundane mechanisms of social
worlds.[^04SeriesIntroduction_16] For instance, Susan Leigh Star has argued that essential
infrastructures — such as for water or electricity — are often
overlooked and under-appreciated until something goes wrong; breakdown
reveals behind-the-scenes activities ordinarily taken for granted.[^04SeriesIntroduction_17]
And as Luke Munn argues, failure is now ‘designed into’ the ‘resilience’
of data center infrastructures — rendering them operational imaginaries
for future possibilities through enactments in the present.[^04SeriesIntroduction_18]

Yet, while failure is a familiar topic *of* research, failure *in* and
as a tactic *of* research is far less visible, valued, and explored.

Research failure rarely features in finished scholarly and artwork. More
often, it is cleaned-up in the final polished argument or piece. When it
does appear — often in the form of mess, mistakes, and mishaps — it is
framed as unexpected problems to be solved or navigated around, such as
the ‘confessions in the field’ genre.[^04SeriesIntroduction_19] Ethnography has a long
tradition of disclosing moments of failure in the field as
breakthroughs.[^04SeriesIntroduction_20] While providing fascinating insights in the
realities of research, failure of this type rarely challenges
methodological practices, data collection, analytic teachings, or
normative research outputs. We seldom learn from them — except to avoid
whatever happened from happening again.

In conventional methods textbooks, failing is largely presented as the
result of poor preparation and execution. It is written of in terms of
what-not-to-do and workarounds via a plethora of techniques for erasing
awkward data and resolving problems and closing down the unexpected and
tangential. As Christine Hine critiques: ‘Our methodological instincts
are to clean up complexity and tell straightforward linear stories, and
thus we tend to exclude descriptions that are faithful to experiences of
mess, ambivalence, elusiveness and multiplicity.’[^04SeriesIntroduction_21] Another type of
failure in research resonates with popular tech-entrepreneurial
discourse. Here, failing is viewed as heroic, individualistic, and
heteronormative in tone, and often instrumentalized as part of a linear
success story. Some, like Appadurai and Alexander, argue that this kind
of failure is blind to conventional tropes and, as such, ‘produces and
sustains cultural fantasies and regimes of expectations.’[^04SeriesIntroduction_22]

Here we seek to argue that failure isn’t the opposite of success —
rather it is a productive way of being in the world that acknowledges
the inequalities, contingencies, subjectivities and collaboration in,
and with, the field. Drawing from stories in the field, we explore how
to think and write about failure in ways that acknowledge it as an
important part of the researcher’s journey — from being reflexive in the
field, to designing in contingency through iteration, to how to
understand social impact in dynamic ways.

The authors in this collection are also interested in usurping the idea
that failing is only possible for the successful, beyond the precarity
of academic life. Instead, by attempting to reclaim failure, in multiple
forms, we want to ‘escape the punishing norms that discipline behavior
and manage human development’ and which ‘clean boundaries between \[…\]
winners and losers’.[^04SeriesIntroduction_23] We are open to practices of failure that
de-link from conventional systems of knowledge and research practice.
Taking a decolonizing approach, we set out to rethink and rework failing
in research in terms of the enduring power and influence of ‘imperial
legacies of Western knowledge and the ways in which those legacies
continue to influence knowledge institutions to the exclusions of
Indigenous peoples and their aspirations’.[^04SeriesIntroduction_24]

## Failure as a workshop

As mentioned, this book emerged from a critical making workshop hosted
at RMIT Europe in July 2018. While the primary theme was failure, it was
designed to discuss best practices for creative, impactful research
methods.[^04SeriesIntroduction_25] Led by Larissa Hjorth, it featured 11 interdisciplinary
researchers from a wide range of disciplines including sociology,
anthropology, geography, STS, game studies, digital media, design, and
creative arts. They travelled from Aarhus, Barcelona, Leiden, London,
Madrid, Manchester, and Melbourne. Everyone was asked to present on the
following questions:

-   How has my work or method failed in a particular project?

-   What do we learn from failure?

-   What are some of the habitual failure expectations we make when we
    design our research?

-   How does failure play into the process of creative research design
    and practice?

-   How can we think about doing impactful methods and what are some of
    the failures?

The goal of this workshop was to explore experiences of research failure
and build conceptual understandings of and practical solutions for
innovative creative methods that address challenges in doing
collaborative, interdisciplinary work. Through a series of scenarios and
examples, we mapped it as a generative space for recalibration,
adjustment, and attunement. These examples were then discussed in terms
of various contexts: understanding and working with failure for
students; with peers and partners; and future interdisciplinary
collaborative scenarios. Together we explored various tropes around
failure — not just as a creative opportunity for recalibrating methods,
research questions, and external expectations, but also as a way of
knowing the world, and, most importantly, failure as a vehicle for
critiquing larger issues around the challenges of the academic
landscape.

## Failurists Collective

This collection has emerged out of continued conversations sparkled by
the initial workshop. It features several of the participants and more
colleagues around the world. In the following pages, interdisciplinary
researchers and practitioners share their practice, insights, and
challenges while discussing key tropes in the failurist taxonomy (see
Figure 1.5). Disciplines are even more diverse: architecture, digital
arts, cultural studies, design, media studies, sociology, and STS.
Everyone was asked to reflect on the following questions in relation to
failure in their own research:

-   How can we be more faithful to failure in research?

-   How might failure in research be viewed as a form of disciplined
    undisciplining?

-   Can failure be a tactic for wielding, unraveling, or enabling
    different kinds of power?

-   Can failing uncover hidden heteronormative and colonial systems of
    oppression?

-   How, when, and why should researchers hold onto, value, or argue for
    failure?

-   How might failing help us to think, feel, see, smell, speak, act,
    and know differently?

Together we reflect upon the role of creative interventions as a
critical mode for methods, research techniques, fieldwork, and knowledge
transmission (to publics). Here, failure is considered a productive part
of engaging *with* and *in* the field. It is about acknowledging the
‘mess’ of the social and how we need methods, modes of attunement, and
knowledge translation that address this complexity in nuanced ways.[^04SeriesIntroduction_26]
We organize this eclectic mindhive for thinking and feeling through
failure and failurist actions in four sections: Section I: Digitality,
Archives, and Design; Section II: Care/Activism; Section III: Creative
Critical Interventions; and Section IV: Play and the Senses.

The sections are dynamic and seek to coalesce various ways of thinking
about the concept and practice of failure. The sections weave in
different subjectivities, relationalities, and positionalities — rhythms
reflecting the numerous material, social, and digital encounters. Each
subtheme is an invitation to probe certain areas of failure in all its
complexity; an invitation to sit with someone’s own lived experience of
failure and how it manifests in research practice and theory. What does
failure mean? What does it do? What does putting failure under the
microscope do to our assumptions around ontology and epistemologies? How
can it be deployed to challenge norms in a time of great uncertainty,
crisis, and anxiety? And what are some of the ways resilience and
failure are interrelated?

We begin the book with the Section I: Digitality, Archives and Design*,*
which discusses classic sites of failure in research. While the fields
of digitality, archives, and design can broadly encompass many things,
this section spans research *with* and *on* computers, patent archives,
mobile phones, social media, and big data. Few researchers would be
without a story of malfunction, loss, or disruption of some regard to
these kinds of essential tools or sites designed to host, support, or
enhance research practice. Our perspective on failure goes beyond the
usual breakdown, complicating the normative binaries of success or
failure, to deliberately blur the idea of something working or not
working. Although moments of crisis might catalyze an initial happening,
authors in this section collectively ‘stay with the trouble’ of the
unexpected, while simultaneously broadening learnings and insights far
beyond the immediate unfolding issue.[^04SeriesIntroduction_27]

The authors in this section share and discuss failure in classrooms,
museums, archives, on screen, and in ethnographic fieldwork. They
explore it in relation to professional contexts and personal experience,
in the present and in the past. And they ask questions, reflecting on
the feelings and learnings, the impacts on others, and how failure
shapes research planning, questions, and outputs.

We start with Jessamy Perriam, who shares her experiences of researching
Instagram, hashtags and selfie sticks in ‘Making Friends with Failure in
STS’. She reflects on ‘rookie errors’ in past projects, learnings in
practice and what happens when ideas develop along the way. Rather than
feeling embarrassed or pressured to make a failed experience productive,
she discusses attempts to make friends with failures, and asks: ‘How do
we think about them not as offcuts of the research, but as a part of our
narrative as researchers?’

Emma Fraser and Clancy Wilmott’s chapter ‘‘No Device Found’: Failure and
Frustration in Critical Digital Methodologies’ starts with the premise
of problematic digital media. Many devices and systems are always in a
state of needing updates, maintenance, and ongoing care and repair. The
authors reframe the media and mediums in their practice, shifting
perspectives from what they call ‘perfect machines with imperfect users,
to imperfect machines: glitch-filled, design-limited, dust-ridden, bound
by bodged code, and held together by loose connections’.

Kat Jungnickel then takes us into patent archives to investigate data
riddled with gaps, erasures, and silences in ‘Patent Failure, Researcher
Failure, Archive Failure: Getting Inventive with the Study of
Inventions’. She focuses on what archives reveal and conceal and
explores failures from three perspectives: inventors and inventions,
researchers and research, and the archive itself. Throughout, she
explores different ways of getting at data that may not be there and
‘questions the politics that shape collections’.

In ‘Failure as Reflexive Method to Think Otherwise’, Annette Markham
explores the common view of failure as something bad, negative, or the
opposite of success. She discusses how these perspectives can be
socialized into researchers, moving from an experience into a personal
attribute and can be difficult to shift. By exploring ideas of failure
in and outside academia she sets out to ‘build the conceptual notion
that failure is nothing more or less than an outcome of an experiment or
action’.

Everyday memory and forgetfulness in terms of gendered research and
ethnography is central to Anna Hickey Moody’s chapter ‘Digital Agency
and the Authorship of Failure’. She focuses on the ‘politics of feeling
like a failure’ and how this can shape, and be shaped by, gendered
research experiences. Examples of this might be when researchers get
locked out of devices, get hacked, or lose data in different ways. She
asks: ‘how we can reclaim and articulate that experience of failure in a
gendered world of research and digital media?’

All the chapters in this section articulate a more creative, expansive,
and open approach to failure rather than assuming everything is fine,
will work, or won’t break. Things rarely, of course, go as planned. And
not everything that goes awry can be necessarily avoided, nor should be.
These authors remind us that research generates not only knowledge and
insight, but also new experiences and more questions. As Linda Dement’s
‘Schematic of an Art Failure’ (artwork) delightfully shows, sometimes
art and answers can emerge as ‘leakage from the wreck’ of a project.

We then move onto Section II: Care/Activism*,* where authors explore the
tensions, contradictions, intentions, challenges, interconnectedness,
and executions of navigating risk and reflecting on failure (the good,
bad, and ambiguous). The unifying theme in this section is the desire to
‘do something’, whether to pierce through feelings of inertia, to act
against complex systems of injustice, or to offer alternative ways of
seeing, knowing, doing, and being with others. The authors make visible
the messy terrain of failure in concept and practice — in private,
public, institutional, and global contexts where navigating complexity,
uncertainty and vulnerability helps to create feedback loops, tools, and
scaffolding for experiential learning, knowledge-sharing, harm
reduction, course correction, and radical empathy for self and others
known/unknown, living or yet-to-be-born. Authors in this section are
speculative futurists, artists, scholars — all, could be regarded (if
not already self-identifying) as care-givers and activists or activist
researchers.

We begin with Jen Rae and Claire G. Coleman’s ‘Reworlding: Speculative
Futuring in the Endtimes, in the Everywhen’. The authors introduce the
ecological state of refugia, an environment where organisms living in
hostile conditions retreat to in order to reorganize their biological
processes. They must adapt to survive. The authors, through the Centre
for Reworlding, ask ‘what are we willing to give up and/or fight for in
the greatest challenge facing humanity? Where to we begin?’ The authors
propose ‘reworlding’ as a means of reorganizing our systems for the
health and wellbeing of future ancestors. Through their speculative
futuring practice of reworlding, failure is fodder for navigating risk
and decoupling from maladaptive ways of engaging with the climate crisis
(the ultimate failure of colonialism and capitalism). We adapt or we
succumb.

Adaptation is prevalent in Julienne van Loon and Kelly Hussey-Smith’s
chapter ‘Failure and Interruption: Creative Carers in a Time of
COVID-19’*.* Their research engaged with twenty-two creative practice
researchers in Melbourne, Australia working and caring from home (WCFH)
during six lockdowns stretching over 260 days between March 2020 and
October 2021. Their research explores the difficult and debilitating
impact of juggling work and the invisible aspects of care labor
compounded by stress and anxieties of an uncertain future and
perceptions of failure. By making visible the participants’ experiences,
challenges, and perceptions of failure, new possibilities emerge for
adaptation and understanding collective failure.

Li Jönsson and Kristina Lindström’s chapter ‘Who Cares About Fågeltofta?
Failing to Grieve Landscapes in Transitions’ explores the disconnect
between anticipatory grief and sacrifice as a means to probe larger
questions of collective failure and how we might find balance between
the destruction of other lifeworlds and the need to ensure a sustainable
future. Learning how their *Clayworks* project failed to collectively
practice pre-solastalgic grief with the local community opened up some
of the tensions and contradictions implicit in transitioning to a
carbon-free society and the values placed on maintaining the status quo
of mobility and modern lifestyles over places of belonging and
connection.

Sam Hind’s chapter offers a ‘methodological framework for how to examine
navigational failures considering navigation as instituting networks of
care or ‘care-tographies’’ — a means to mediate care relations between
people their worlds, what they do, how they operate, and what their
needs are. By approaching navigational failures beyond specific
technological or systems ‘failure’ and evidenced by protests and
autonomous driving, Hind suggest the framework could provide greater
understanding of who is impacted and why, potentially offering a new
evaluative tool for designers, map makers, and software designers.

Lekshmy Parameswaran similarly doesn’t shy away from failure as material
informing her practice at The Care Lab. There is joy in the messy
terrain where failure can be a creative force and in doing so builds
capacity to be bold and confident in navigating risk and uncertainties.
In her chapter ‘Failure is Inevitable in Care Activism’*,* Parameswaran
offers the building blocks of a Failurists’ Toolkit, where failure can
support changemaking. Reflections and questions may offer more effective
ways to scale and disseminate new modes of care.

Closing the Care/Activism section is Syrus Marcus Ware’s chapter
‘Failure — A Day Fractured Forever, and Ensuring Change: The Summer
Uprisings of 2020 and Lessons Learned From the Frontlines’. Like
Parameswaran, who seeks to transform public systems of healthcare
through care activism, and Rae and Coleman, who offer a vision of a
future created by 100 years of reworlding, Ware seeks to abolish racism,
violence, and ableism in law enforcement through activism and
solidarity. Believing there is a better way to have ‘safety, security,
and solutions to conflict, crisis, and harm without carceral violence
and punishment’, Ware is a voice for many silenced by oppression. Ware
shares the triumphant story of the Black Lives Matter and Defund the
Police action on the streets of Toronto, Canada, before unpicking the
inequities and multiple failures (personal and systemic) that arose in
their follow-on action to dismantle monuments of slavery and
colonialism.

In Section III, we explore the concept of creative-critical
interventions as a core principle for understanding the complexity of
failure in research as part of a broader, increasingly neo-liberal
university context. Can failure allow for us to challenge organizational
success matrices and to explore the uneven power relations and how we
might radically revise current processes to address crises and
uncertainties? How does failure expose different textures of practice,
infrastructures, and systems? Indeed, this section exposes many of the
tensions around conceiving failure as productive and its relationship to
risk, iteration, and experimentation and how the institution
‘interprets’ these acts.

As Lisa LeFevre notes, failure in art practice has a long history of
challenging norms of success. She argues that artists embrace failure as
a theme, strategy, and worldview — especially in face of growing crises
and uncertainty. For LeFevre, ‘between the two subjective poles of
success and failure lies a space of potentially productive operations
where paradox rules and dogma is refused’.[^04SeriesIntroduction_28] And yet, how does
failure translate in practice and systemically? Does failure as a
process challenge institutional dogma in an age of neo-liberalism? Or is
it just the performance of inclusion? This section examines
critical-creative interventions across macro and micro scales.

We begin with Nanna Verhoeff and Iris van der Tuin’s exploration of
‘Failure is a Project’. Starting with the *Journal of Trial & Error
(JOTE)* — which focused on publishing short empirical articles examining
‘what went wrong?’ — they eloquently traverse the ways in which failure
has been addressed by key social and creative scholars. As they note,
‘in the reality of science in the making, failure is, quite simply,
daily practice’. From STS — which has a long rich history in exposing
failure as core part of technological development and research — and
Latour, to Appadurai and Alexander’s ‘habitual failure’[^04SeriesIntroduction_29] and Legacy
Russell’s paradoxical notion of the glitch, Verhoeff and van der Tuin
highlight the productive role of failure to *linger* and *drift*
throughout the research process. As they note, acknowledging failure
allows for an emphasis back on the process, constant iteration, and
drafting. This echoes the work of games for change designers John Sharp
and Colleen Macklin, who argue that failure and iteration are a
co-dependent and crucial part of the creative process. [^04SeriesIntroduction_30]

We then move onto Olivia Khoo’s critical analysis of all that is wrong
with neo-liberal systems in the academy — especially if one is colored
or queer. As she notes, she was deemed by a colleague as the ‘triple
threat’ — Asian, female, and queer. Khoo explores what failure has to
offer race and cultural studies — from Halberstam’s suggestion that
failure ‘allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline
behaviour’[^04SeriesIntroduction_31] and Melissa Gregg’s challenge of the very use of
‘productivity’ as the right measure[^04SeriesIntroduction_32], to Arlie Russell Hochschild’s
emotional work.[^04SeriesIntroduction_33]

As Khoo identifies, administration work is about often tacit emotional
labor, which often gets done by women. This complex pastoral work is
also often overlooked in favor of the superstar who avoids
administration. The focus on ‘joy’ is partly ironic but also points to
the work in cultural studies to queer such normalized concepts — for
example feminist Lynne Segal has argued against increasing individualism
by embracing a collective joy approach.[^04SeriesIntroduction_34] Turning to the important
work by the likes of Sara Ahmed, Khoo evocatively argues for ‘failure as
a tactic of new knowledge formation, embodying emotional resilience, and
providing opportunities for us to imagine new ways of “doing” the
university differently outside of the institutionalized mandate to
continually succeed and be productive’.

Continuing the theme about systemic inequality and for failure to push
against neo-liberal regimes, we turn to Grace McQuilten’s ‘Who Can
Afford to Fail? Art and Risk in an Era of Precarity’. Focusing on risk
and failure in creative practice, McQuilten highlights that the right to
‘failure’ is a privilege — as she asks: is failure a privilege of those
who have the resources and capacity to fail? Moreover, she argues, ‘how
much can we ask people to contribute — both in human capacity and income
— to realize a risky project, and risk failure?’ Teasing out the tension
between risk and failure, McQuilten critically reflects on two
curatorial research projects — *Remote-Controlled Terrorist Coffin*[^04SeriesIntroduction_35]
and *The Magic Tent.*[^04SeriesIntroduction_36]

We then turn to Chantal Faust’s ‘Coloring in the Void: Absurdity and
Contemporary Art’ in which she performs and embodies LeFevre’s notion of
failure as a key site for creative process and rumination. Drawing on
the song *Boo Boo Bird* by the Scottish poet, songwriter, and humorist
Ivor Cutler, Faust investigates the relationship between failing the
absurd and failing as part of what she sees as a new kind of absurdist
tendency in contemporary art practice. As she argues, while failing is
about being out of tune, what does this mean in a world that is
increasingly discordant?

The section then finishes with Nancy Mauro-Flude’s art pages *Erroneous
Interventions into Infrastructure | The &lt;&lt;&lt; Pirate Girls
&gt;&gt;&gt; say...* As a feminist artist who exposes inequalities and
injustices around data and code, Mauro-Flude’s work takes Legacy’s
notion of the glitch and failure for a walk. She asks us to consider the
agency of technology in our lives and how feminist practice can provide
new interventive ways to challenge the normalizing tendencies.

In Section IV: Play and the Senses, we explore play in research as
intricately related to failure and multisensorial experiences. Playful
approaches and, in particular, its qualities of probing and
experimenting, imply ambiguity and speculative thinking, thus also open
the door to risky, tricky, unscripted, and misunderstood situations.
Such glitches and trip-ups can lead to a deeper insight in underlying
concepts and assumptions. Furthermore, they can also produce unexpected,
creative, and imaginary insights, stories, and outcomes. Playful
approaches allow us to step out of direct functionality or a wish of a
direct or specific outcome. This is close to what Haraway says about
play:

> It’s not a matter of direct functionality. We need to develop
> practices for thinking about those forms of activity that are not
> caught by functionality, those which propose the possible-but-not-yet,
> or that which is not-yet but still open. [^04SeriesIntroduction_37]

That play has the potential to invite failure in research is due to
their similarity with (non)practices. Indeed, as game scholar Jesper
Juul pointed out in *The Art of Failure: An Essay on the Pain of Playing
Video Games,* it would be wrong to simply understand playing games in
terms of fun, as play is far more related to experiences of pain,
frustration, and failing to resolve this pain.[^04SeriesIntroduction_38] In this section we
push this claim a bit further, by proposing that this is not only an
important part of games, but also of play and creativity in the field
and the methods employed in situ.

Closely related to play and failure is the question of how we account
for multi-sensorial experiences in terms of failure. It can be said that
failure can anyhow lay bare parts of research that are more uneven,
visceral, and painful, such as grief, frustration, or hitting a brick
wall. Yet play can transform these experiences into something more
openly creative, reflective, and meaningful. Furthermore play (as
closely related to risk-taking) can encourage researchers to engage with
such experiences actively and willfully by searching for the what-if and
probing the evenness, functionally, and viability of the everyday
through playfully engaging with the senses.

The overarching questions of this section are: how do play and playing
with the senses allow for and encourage failure, and how can it be
valued as part of research? How can we conceptualize the relation
between methods, multi-sensorial play, and failure? Can this give an
impetus to a different approach to research? By engaging with these
questions this section wants to make a case for including failure, play,
and multi-sensorial experiences as possible parts of research and
methods. This can be informative for collaborative and creative
fieldwork, but also for other research practices, ranging from AI (e.g.
creative indicators in machine learning), data sprints, vernacular
mapping, and the use of (digital) research tools.[^04SeriesIntroduction_39] It can enable us
to feel, do, (for)see, produce, and analyze social realities and daily
practices differently.

All the chapters in this section deal with these aspects in different
yet related ways. The chapter of Sybille Lammes argues that the
experience of boredom in play — which is a failure of action rather than
play — can create space for reflection that holds great value for
researchers that use playful methods. In the following chapter, Larissa
Hjorth draws attention to how her ethnographies, to which playful
methods are intrinsic, always entail kinds of failure. She shows how
failure allowed her to develop a deeper understanding of less human
centered multi-species kinship as well as of this failed era of the
Anthropocene and the feelings of grief and loss that are intrinsically
part of it.

Kate McLean speaks of failure of smell in her chapter. During her
creative smellmapping fieldwork (such as smellhunts), she focuses on
smell as one of the least verifiable senses, which is therefore
scientifically tricky to validate and for some failing research
de-facto. She discusses a series of mini-failures to substantiate how
smell can be related to failure on many levels, from the smell of
failure of the Anthropocene (e.g. pollution), to the failure of design
in fieldwork and the failure to capture and record smell.

This section ends with a short provocation by Juliette van Loon about a
playful intervention, in which she invited twenty Australian scholars
from different fields to engage with ‘playful risk-taking’ through
writing a Tanka. In these poems they engaged with a playful reflection
on their research practice in which failures of thinking and doing are
transformed into more open ‘admissions’ of feelings of rejection,
limitation, grief, frustration, and lack of ideas or resources. Together
these chapters show how play as an approach can help us to appreciate
and openly address failure as an integral part of our research practices
and can foreground feelings, experiences, and the senses as part of that
process.

## A *Failurfesto*

This book aims to offer provocations to further discussions around
failure. In doing so, we conclude with a manifesto — a *failurfesto* —
as a call to action for future research in increasingly uncertain and
precarious times. Our *failurfesto* proposes:

> We do not seek to fail more or differently.
>
> We do not see failure as something to be avoided, cleaned up, or
> concealed, nor as a normative part of the grinding journey to success.
>
> > We critically resist separating failure into subject, method or
> > approach. Instead, we view it as something worthy of considered
> > attention in research that has the potential to unravel, reveal or
> > open up alternatives, unexpected combinations and narratives,
> > thicken scholarly practice and onto-epistemologies.
>
> *We work together to draw attention to innovative ways of thinking
> about failure as a productive constituent of research processes and
> the impact journey. *
>
> *We acknowledge the ways in which working in the field of the social
> involves dynamic processes that constantly disrupt research questions
> and methods. *
>
> *We seek to make visible the processes of uncertainty, risk and play
> that are core to research. *
>
> *We aim to learn from failure.*
>
> *We try to witness, acknowledge, and sit with failure.*
>
> *We attempt to embrace failurism.*
>
> *We need to become failurists.*
