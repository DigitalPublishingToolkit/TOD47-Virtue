# Failure in the Field: Ethnography, Iteration, Multispecies/Ecological Relationality and Grief

### Larissa Hjorth

I fail all the time.

Methodologically.

Epistemologically.

Research translation.

Research creation.

Multispecies relationality.

And each failure I mourn.

Waves of grief.

I sit with them.

I listen to them.

I learn from them.

## Prologue

In this chapter, I explore some of my various ethnographic failures. As
I explore the limits of ethnography, I also examine how failure and
grief are interwoven. Rather than ignoring failure and grief, I argue we
need rituals to acknowledge the failure, to sit with it for all its
awkwardness, and to grieve it. I am interested in grief as a quotidian
practice that can help us connect, listen, and learn. From failure and
grief we can heighten our awareness, curiosity, and reflexivity to
possibilities and uncertainties. Rather than grief and failure being
individuated and thus neoliberal, I argue that both are practices that
are embedded in our relationalities, kinning, and being in the world.
Let’s begin the meander. In homes. With animals. In climate disaster.

## Enter the Messy Field: Failure as Iteration

Like many homes around the world, the Madisons’ household in Adelaide
(Australia) is playful in many ways. Some areas of the household are
hubs for social activity and media use, while other spaces are quieter
and more contemplative. The emotional fabric of the household follows
certain rhythms of play across the spatial organization of the lounge
room, computer room, and bedrooms. In the communal space of the lounge
room, the play texture becomes more complex. A range of devices and play
practices can be found. This assemblage includes game consoles (Wii and
PlayStation), two iPads on the lounge, and three iPhones. In the
evenings when the parents and their daughter are home, the lounge
becomes the focus for interaction and engagement — a highly social space
for shared conversation, games, and creative play. This play sometimes
includes the Madisons’ cat, Bonnie, who is known to be fond of the iPad
game *Cat Fishing* (Figure 19.1). As is the case in many homes, playful
domestic practices often include family pets. Pets, companion animals,
or what Anne Galloway calls our ‘more-than-human’ companions play an
essential role in many humans’ kinship.[^27Larissa_1]

The Madison household contains many stories of intergenerational and
multispecies play and playfulness. In the domestic environment, this
infusion of playfulness throughout the emotional and material space of
the home might be described as a kind of ambient play.[^27Larissa_2] Ambient play
is the dynamics and relationality of media, human, and more-than-humans
as they move in and out of the background to the foreground and back
again. When I began my collaborative ethnographic research, I thought I
was studying the relationship between intergenerational humans and media
in households. However, as we began to enter people’s homes and talk to
our participants, animals started to get in the way.

Cats siting on laptops in protest.

Dogs Skyping.

Cats playing games on the iPads.

The list went on.

The human participants constantly spoke and engaged with their
more-than-humans. Before long, we realized that we had underestimated
the more-than-human counterparts in our domestic environments. In
Australia, two thirds of households have pets that the humans define as
crucial family members.[^27Larissa_3] One third of Australians prefer animals to
humans.[^27Larissa_4] We had failed. This was not digital ethnography. This field
demanded multispecies ethnography. And more.

Our research question and methods failed.

We needed to revise it all.

Pivot.

## Ethnography and Failure

Being an ethnographer is always about failure. Stories of failure shape
the ethnographer’s ability to iterate — demanding them to listen and
being reflexive. Iteration has become a key tool and framework for many
creative disciplines to actively engage with failure in critical and
productive ways.[^27Larissa_5] It’s about the failure of the research question to
stand still in the movement of the field. It’s about the failure of
methods that need to be reworked in and through the field.

Behind every ethnography is a story of how the researcher thought they
were going to study something in the field, but then the field became
something else (or was something else from the beginning?). It’s about
playing with endless uncertainty; trying to remain true to the field —
its people, its more-than-humans, its stories, its ways of being. It is
this failure that is crucial to doing ethnography. It involves a deep
listening and reflexivity that means we, as ethnographers, are
contingent to the field. As I will suggest, multispecies ethnography can
help us to acknowledge failure as it moves in and through life, death,
and afterlife continuities, resetting our attunement to relationality.

For James Clifford, ethnography — anthropology’s methodological approach
— has always been interested in ‘invention’ not ‘representation’.[^27Larissa_6]
This interventive, creative, and non-representative role of ethnography
is taken up by Philip Vannini in his ‘animating lifeworlds’, in which he
argues ‘(n)on-representational theoretical ideas have influenced the way
ethnographers tackle important methodological and conceptual
undercurrents in their work, such as vitality, performativity,
corporeality, sensuality, and mobility’.[^27Larissa_7] This is ethnography that
embraces uncertainty and risk as part of its methodological toolkit.

While my first decade of ethnographies were focused on intergenerational
relationships in and through media, loss and disaster started to take my
focus from 2011. Personal loss of a family member was proceeded by the
Japanese Fukushima disaster in March of that year, followed by a series
of natural disasters such as floods and fires. The world, as a field,
was telling me something. I had failed to listen. I had got sidetracked
on the details. I had to listen. Listen deeply. I realized that I had
been failing to listen to the various levels and textures of grief — not
just personal but rather cultural, social, and ecological. If I didn’t
listen and write these stories, the grief could become trauma.

Listening to failure.

Being attuned to failure.

Failure as a way to iterate in the field with the field.

## More-Than-Human Ethnography: Human Exceptionalism Failure

Multispecies researchers have challenged scholarly traditions, moving
away from ‘default’ human exceptionalism and towards more complex
relational processes. More-than-human relations have been the ongoing
focus of a number of multispecies and animal studies scholars including
Donna Haraway[^27Larissa_8], Anna Tsing[^27Larissa_9], Anne Galloway[^27Larissa_10], Thom van
Dooren[^27Larissa_11], Eduardo Kohn[^27Larissa_12], Rebekah Fox and Nancy Gee[^27Larissa_13], and
Andrea Petitt and Brandt-off[^27Larissa_14], among many others, who have actively
challenged traditional ways of thinking about our being-in-the-world.
For Haraway, the failure of science and technology in exacerbating
rather than providing solutions to ecological destruction, challenges us
to ‘radically rethink’ the relationship between humans and ‘nature’, and
dilate our sense of affinity, responsibility, and care to encompass
animals as co-evolutionary ‘kin’.[^27Larissa_15]

Environmental humanities has long been focused on the ethical and
careful ways in which we might listen to the world as a relationality
between human and non-humans. Listening here is about de-centring the
human as centre and central. As Anja M. Kanngieser and Zoe Todd note,
Western thought has long (and problematically) separated place, thought,
and relations.[^27Larissa_16] Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe scholar Vanessa Watts
identify this as separating ‘ontology from epistemology, knowing from
being, and place from story’.[^27Larissa_17] The relationality between humans,
non-humans, and land is co-constitutive and reciprocal. Such approaches
can be called a ‘kincentric’ approach to environmental humanities.[^27Larissa_18]

According to Van Horn et al., we need to radically revise the
relationality between humans and more-than-humans in terms of kinship
and kinning.[^27Larissa_19] For Anna Tsing, understanding multispecies approaches
requires acknowledging that ‘human nature is an interspecies
relationship’.[^27Larissa_20] As Tsing notes, adopting ‘an interspecies frame’
opens up ‘possibilities for biological as well as cultural research
trajectories’.[^27Larissa_21] Anthropology has long been interested in
problematising the role of representation and the politics of speaking
on behalf of others — including more-than-humans and non-humans.

Galloway’s ‘more-than-human design’ also deploys invention as a
speculative proposition in which an interspecies frame is sketched
through complex and intertwined ethnographies of the various
actors.[^27Larissa_22] Galloway’s interest concerns ‘how we might develop an
understanding of non-human engagement’ through speculative design and a
sociology of associations and expectations, so as to better comprehend
‘the productive or generative capacities of human/nonhuman
relations’.[^27Larissa_23] Galloway puts failure at the centre of her exploration
— constantly iterating in hyper-reflexive ways to the various human,
non-human, and more-than-human actors. Failure is not a mistake. It is
about acknowledging limitations. As Galloway argues, ‘the ability to
invoke, trouble and “inhabit” other worlds and worldviews is
instrumental to qualitative research’s critical and creative role in
knowledge-making’.[^27Larissa_24] This troubling of knowledge-making is crucial in
my ethnographies whereby I deploy creative practice and ‘research
creation’ (i.e. using creative methods to engage participants and
research translation to engage publics).[^27Larissa_25]

For many humans, animals are a core part of their kinship, requiring us
to rethink kinship to encompass multispecies relationality as well as
other ways of being and knowing.[^27Larissa_26] According to human-animal
ethnographers Petitt and Brandt-off, understanding this relationality of
the ‘multispecies triad’ can help us developed a more nuanced model of
multispecies intersectionality and kinship.[^27Larissa_27] In understanding
multispecies kinship, we need to acknowledge processes of living and
also dying — requiring us to recognize the complex textures of grief
involved in life’s transition. We need a multispecies kinship model that
allows us to witness and show the growing stories of grief, to construct
a grief literacy framework that can allow productive ways to act and
change our current predicament. This kinship model also needs to
acknowledge other relationalities across human, non-human, living, and
non-living ties. It needs to move beyond empathic failure.

## Empathic Failure: Failure to Mourn in World of Increasing Disaster

Failure isn’t just related to the multispecies relationality of kinship.
It is also about how we connect the land and the environment in a time
of the Anthropocene (i.e. increasing catastrophic impacts of human
activity on the earth’s climate and ecosystems).[^27Larissa_28] For Richard
Eckersely, the threat of the potential climate apocalypse takes three
responses: nihilism, fundamentalism, and activism.[^27Larissa_29] In an
increasingly unprecedented precedent of climate disaster and pandemics,
we need to attune and enhance our empathy and resilience through
intersectional grief empathy and grief literacy.[^27Larissa_30]

Grief reflects cultural hierarchies.[^27Larissa_31] Some forms of grief are more
visible than others and other forms of grief are
disenfranchised/illegitimated (unacknowledged)[^27Larissa_32] — that is, grief or
loss that cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially
supported. Grief needs to be witnessed[^27Larissa_33] and can take many media
forms, including affective witnessing[^27Larissa_34] — whereby media blurs
distinctions between mourner and witness — and mobile witnessing —
whereby the mobile device frames the experience.[^27Larissa_35]

And yet, there are many forms of disenfranchised grief emerging — from
ecological grief (eco-grief)[^27Larissa_36] to unanticipated futures.[^27Larissa_37] As
Spain and colleagues note, this ‘occurs within a broader system of
empathic failure, where social, psychological, and relational processes
interact to inhibit social support’.[^27Larissa_38] For Neimeyer and Jordan,
disenfranchised grief is part of an ‘empathic failure’ across four
levels: (a) self with self, (b) self with family, (c) self with
community, and (d) self with transcendent reality.[^27Larissa_39] For Doka,
disenfranchised grief is loss is not socially accepted or
recognized.[^27Larissa_40] According to Doka, rituals like eulogies play a crucial
role in allowing the ‘right to grieve’, which can then provide social
support. If we, as Breen and colleagues argue, develop grief literacy,
disenfranchised grief could become increasingly uncommon.[^27Larissa_41]

I would like to argue that through multispecies ethnography we can glean
other ways of being in the world, ones that acknowledge life, death, and
afterlife continuities.[^27Larissa_42] Many have been mourning climate change for
decades — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been
releasing report after report documenting the scientific evidence that
global warming of more than 1.5 degrees is ‘almost inevitable.’ And yet
we have also witnessed decades of disenfranchisement by politicization
and misinformation from fossil fuel lobby groups. And so our mourning
went unacknowledged, turning into trauma.[^27Larissa_43] How can we find hope
through uncertainty and impeding disaster?

I would suggest creative practice offers ways to channel our grief
productively. For example, in Amanda Lohrey’s *The Labyrinth,* a mother
mourns her incarnated son by building a labyrinth in the sand. The
impossible task — failure from the start — is about her journey to find
people willing to build the impossible with her.[^27Larissa_44] The layering of
ecological grief (ecogrief) and the associated distress and melancholy —
what has been called solastaglia — has become palpable in the text.[^27Larissa_45]
And yet there is a struggle to give this grief a shared vocabulary, to
acknowledge it and connect.

Rather than grief being individual, as psychologists might frame it,
cultural studies approaches to grief — such as Judith Butler’s work —
see it as a cultural practice that reflects and reproduces a society’s
norms.[^27Larissa_46] Here, empathic failure can be seen in online vehicles like
Twitter, which are overflowing with disenfranchised grief. Acknowledging
grief can help us understand complex transitions in life and build
resilience around tangible and more tangible forms of loss, from
ecogrief (ecological grief) to the death of a loved one. Phenomena such
as disenfranchised (unacknowledged) grief can lead to health
issues.[^27Larissa_47] The mental health impact of various forms of grief — such
as ecogrief as a response to climate change loss — have become a key
issue impacting our health services.[^27Larissa_48] Grief around the loss of
anticipated futures presented by the pandemic will continue to
grow.[^27Larissa_49] *Solastalgia.*

I want to argue for a hopeful future. I constantly codesign with others
to make alternative possibilities. I workshop in and around failure as
an inevitable part of becoming (see Figures 19.2-19.6).[^27Larissa_50] I workshop
cultural probes like postcards (Figure 19.5) that acknowledge failures,
glitches, cracks,[^27Larissa_51] in which play as a method, series of critical
inquiries and conceptual lens takes us through empathy and risk taking.
In these workshops failure is constantly palpable. Mechanisms like
postcard prompts invite us to listen.

I argue for a future that acknowledges that failure is omnipresent and,
like grief, needs to be sat with; listened to, for all its awkwardness,
its discomfort, its sadness. By acknowledging the limits of ethnography
— even multispecies and ecological approaches — to be in the world, we
are constantly remaining humble to the world. And it is failure’s
ability to connect us with humility that could be the success for a more
caring and sustainable world.
