# Failure in Play: Boredom as Meaningful Ludic Moment

### Sybille Lammes

## Introduction

This chapter is about boredom as a particular kind of failure *in play*.
I contend that boredom is not necessary failure of play — rather it
breaks with a dominant paradigm in play studies that play is an activity
and movement. Such an approach obscures possible translations between
play and boredom and feeds into the assumption that boredom is a failure
of action that needs to be avoided by players, as well as a failure in
how games are designed to keep the ‘flow’ going.

A reconsideration of boredom *in* play is important because we live in
an age in which it becomes increasingly untenable to think of play as a
delineated practice as it is part of fluid assemblages. This also
presents us with instances of hybridization between play and boredom.
Furthermore, the tendency to sever play from boredom rests on a moral
judgement in which play is applauded and boredom is perceived as a moral
failing belonging to the realm of lazy people and under-achievers. This
ethical and binary approach reflects our post-capitalist ideology in
which play has become a virtue[^26Sybille_1] while boredom is something
undesirable, despite paradoxically also embedded with the
post-capitalist condition.

## But What is Play?

Not only players, but also scholars, easily get lost in play.
Definitions of play are manifold: from play more related to games and
rules, to play as a state-of-mind,[^26Sybille_2] to behavioral approaches (play as
flow). The debating of terms is of course part of any scholarly debate
and can even be productive. It’s part of the game. Should we, for
example, make a difference between play and games (a distinction that
not every language allows us to make)? Is play a delineated activity
(Huizinga’s magic circle), or should we speak rather of a lusory
attitude? Or should we, as some game designers would prefer, approach
play as a closed formal structure?

Yet however different the stakes and opinions may be about what play is,
isn’t, or should be, there is one particular premise in the field of
game and play studies where academics seem to be less at odds about.
Their approaches, fields, and disciplines may be diverse, and this may
sometimes even lead to contradictory ideas (e.g. is play medium
specific?), but there is one trait on which scholars seem to close rank,
and that is that play is about *doing* and *action*. For example,
Starbuck and Webster write that play is ‘a socio-cultural involvement in
activities that give participants pleasure’[^26Sybille_3]*,* while play-scholar
Miguel Sicart writes that ‘play is brought by people to the complex
interrelations with and between things that form daily life’. [^26Sybille_4] Game
scholar Schell asserts that ‘a game is a problem-solving activity,
approached with a playful attitude’,[^26Sybille_5] and play designer Jane
McGonigal defines play as ‘the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary
obstacles’.[^26Sybille_6] From a communication studies perspective, Bateson
understands play as ‘the exchange of the metacommunicative
message\[…\]These actions, in which we now engage’,[^26Sybille_7] and Walz states
that play is about pleasure and ‘is grounded in and executed through
movement’.[^26Sybille_8]

This small anthology may be somewhat confusing, again showing the width
and variety of approaches to play depending on field, theory, and
research object. Yet what is striking about these diverse conceptual
approaches to the ludic is that they all stress that play is about doing
and the pleasure that this doing or acting can bring. To extract the
kind of verbs and words predominantly used by game and play scholars
from these definitions: activity, attempting, bringing, pleasure,
exchange, engage, movement.

Hence what play seems *not* to be about, according to such definitions,
is about *not* doing, unattempting, non-engagement, stillness. Although
not explicitly indicated in the above, some leading scholars in the
field go a step further and firmly state that play fails when activity
ceases. Being lost in play, or in the flow, is for them about anything
but nothingness or stillness, let alone boredom. Most famously, social
psychologist Csikszentmihalyi proposed a theory of play in which one
enters a state of flow which ends — and thus fails — when boredom takes
over. As he wrote with his colleague Bennett:

> Play may stretch over longer or shorter periods of time but is not
> characterised by boredom or anxiety.[^26Sybille_9] (emphasis added)

Similarly, Mathwick and Rigdon, when discussing online searches as play,
believe that play falters when boredom takes over**:** ‘Boredom during
online information search should be associated with reduced perceptions
of play’.[^26Sybille_10] Also, according to Walz, the cut-off points of play can
be summarized as either over-reaction under-reaction.[^26Sybille_11] What is
intriguing is that such scholars indicate that when boredom kicks in
play always fails. But what if we consider the possibility that play
*includes* or *invites* boredom? In other words, does play necessarily
cease to exist when boredom takes over as a failure of action?

## Play in Boredom

Many scholars have drawn attention to how our Western culture has become
more openly playful since the so-called digital turn and how play has
become more interwoven with areas that have traditionally been viewed as
non-playful. Some have called this transformation a ludification of our
culture[^26Sybille_12] and others a gamification[^26Sybille_13] of our post-capitalist
culture.[^26Sybille_14] Pivotal to this cultural transformation is that, through
our engagement with digital technologies, play has become less
distinguishable from other daily activities or occupations. This
ludification and the merging of play with ‘other’ cultural domains can
manifests itself in different ways. For example, applied games are often
used to improve the quality of life in neighborhoods, or how work in
offices has become transformed to ‘playbour’,[^26Sybille_15] or how running and
exercise that take place on the streets or parks of cities are shared
through location-based games.[^26Sybille_16] Through the user interfaces of
digital media, we engage with the ludic anywhere we are and whatever we
do and form dynamic networks of connections. Playfulness has thus left
the traditional playground and has become an important part of many
other daily activities.

Since the digital turn we can also observe a surge of different playful
engagements that combine play with boredom. Waiting for a connection,
getting lost in *Grand Theft Auto*, waiting for our turn on Tinder: it
seems to become increasingly tricky to think of play as always being the
opposite of boredom and of boredom as a failure of play. This is, for
example, foregrounded in so-called casual games, like *Candy Crush*,
*Mini Metro*, *Farm Heroes*, or *Bejeweled*. These are games with simple
rules, that you can dip in and out of while waiting or passing time.
Such games are often not very complex and are easy to learn and can be
played to manage — so not necessarily to counter — boredom, while on the
go.[^26Sybille_17]

In addition, social platforms and apps have affordances that make users
oscillate between inert play and risky play. Dating apps are an
interesting case in this respect. As a user of Tinder aptly explained,
‘But sometimes I also swipe in a public-private place, such as in idle
moments, when I commute, for example’, and ‘It is a little guilty
experience, I guess, and a little paradoxical. I feel it is between
casting or fishing and playing roulette. I do not know… Tinder sucks
\[…\] (laughs)’.[^26Sybille_18] Here we see that users play the game of Tindering
to pass time during idle moments. It is described as an oscillation
between the act of fishing (as a slow and sometimes boring pastime) and
roulette (as a heightened, risky, and exciting activity).

## Failing Awareness

Media scholar David Berry suggests that there is an intricate relation
between the repetition, automation, and hyper-connectivity within
contemporary cultures and the ways we experience boredom.[^26Sybille_19] Or, as
Heidegger famously wrote in relation to modernity:

> The man of today has no more time for anything, and yet, when he has
> free time, it immediately becomes too long. He must kill long periods
> of time by whiling them away through pastimes \[...\] In this ‘ennui’
> nothing appeals to us anymore, everything has as much or as little
> value as everything else, because a deep boredom penetrates our
> existence to the core. Is this possibly our final condition, that a
> deep boredom, like an insidious fog, creeps to and from in the
> bottomless depths of our existence?[^26Sybille_20]

What Heidegger describes can help to substantiate the paradox of
ludo-boredom[^26Sybille_21] at this time and age further. Indeed, already when
Heidegger was writing about our modern existence, there was this
ontological paradox at work in which we need to have leisure time but
don’t know how to deal with it when we have time off. We have no time to
do anything else but work, but we also fail to know what to do when we
are not working.

Translated to our times, as Berry points out, one could say that this
ennui has taken a new turn. We are now alienated from a *computerized*
and automated world, not in touch with how this determines our actions
and how dependent we are on the networks of control in which we are
embedded. We are never offline and always in the matrix, therefore not
noticing that we are part of it.[^26Sybille_22] We are hyperactive,
hyper-embedded, and hyperconnected, without even noticing it and we need
to be bored *and* play to be weaned off this. Yet — and this is crucial
— what we engage in when we try to disengage is all too often a
reverberation of work. We mimic the tedious practices of labor in our
free time.

What we can learn from Heidegger — but also from Horkheimer and Adorno —
is that work and play bleed into each other and that we often mimic
boring chores we do for work in our time off work.[^26Sybille_23] Hence crushing
candies, minding cattle, driving trucks, clicking buttons, swiping
screens, looking at others playing on YouTube. One could assert that
neologisms like ‘playbor’ or ‘weisure’ literally capitalize on this idea
that play is the prolongation of work, hinting at a merging of play and
labor or work and leisure and propagating a lifestyle in which work is
fun and play is work.

Play is a way to counter our culture of habit and repetition, but can at
the same time reinforce a late-capitalist mentality.[^26Sybille_24] So,
*play-repetition* is a way to keep things nicely ticking over and not
make ideologies fail. It is trying to keep boredom at bay, but inviting
it back in through the backdoor. Over and over again we do the same
tasks, and we replicate that in play, from Tindering to *Candy Crush*,
*Harvest Moon*, and maybe even sometimes in breathing in and out for
meditation or while swimming. Play and boredom can become merged or
hybridized through such repetitions, which may result in a failure of
awareness, but not necessarily in failure of play or ideology.

## Waiting as Ludo-Boredom

Yet sometime things do not go as we expect them to go. The technologies
we use to play fail, for example. No connection with the server, an
error in the software, a flat battery, a stolen phone, a wet phone, a
white spot without reception. But also waiting: waiting for our turn in
a conversation on a new media platform, when playing a turn-based game,
when fishing for possible date. When we allow or have to allow waiting
in play and we don’t engage in Tindering, Facebook scrolling, or
clicking cows, a state of being emerges which is different from
repetition.

Unlike repetition, waiting during play, I would argue, opens up space
for a far more reflective state in which boredom and play can merge.
This can, for example, be a place in which to develop a new strategy, or
to stand as an invisible still hunter waiting for prey, but also for a
play scholar to analyse what’s happening.[^26Sybille_25] These moments are
important points of reflection and can lead to creative and reflective
thinking. This may be what Benjamin meant when he asserted that ‘boredom
is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience’.[^26Sybille_26] It may also
be related to recent research that suggests we underestimate the
creative merit of boredom, often just dismissing it as a failure of
doing. We are, after all, culturally conditioned to think of boredom as
a negative condition that is for the underachievers, the losers, and the
inert. We are conditioned to thin of boredom *as the opposite of
happiness. *

Yet as philosopher Elpidorou pointed out, it may be a very good thing to
be bored: ‘In the absence of boredom, one would remain trapped in
unfulfilling situations, and miss out on many emotionally, cognitively,
and socially rewarding experiences’.[^26Sybille_27] ‘Boredom is both a warning
that we are not doing what we want to be doing and a “push” that
motivates us to switch goals and projects.’[^26Sybille_28] From this perspective,
one could not only conclude that play and boredom have more in common —
as they share this capacity to push us to new creative interventions —
but also that the dichotomy that is often introduced in play-studies
between boredom and play partly rests on a moral judgment that applauds
play and disapproves of boredom, and sees it as a non-desired state of
being, a state of failure.
