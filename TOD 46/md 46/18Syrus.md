# A Day Fractured Forever, and Wnsuing Change: The Summer Uprisings of 2020 and Lessons Learned From the Front Lines

### Syrus Marcus Ware

It was summer — hot and dewy. Black Lives Matter had spent weeks
planning the action after a successful action on Juneteenth of 2020. It
was the middle of what we now lovingly refer to as the summer uprisings
of 2020. People were becoming politicized and getting involved in
actions and activisms around the world in the name of racial justice. In
Tkaronto (the Mohawk name for Toronto, Ontario, Canada), we gathered 80
people — artists and activists on 16 June 2020 to paint a large-scale
7,200 square foot mural on College Street in downtown Tkaronto.

Right in front of the Toronto Police Headquarters, the mural screamed
‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ in massive pink, queer letters. We had taken over
the intersections of Bay and College Streets along with College and
Yonge Streets and painted the large strip of letters between — along the
block of College Street, using rollers and huge buckets of bright pink
paint. As I stood there painting on that hot summer morning, I was
worried; worried we would be attacked by the cops standing and watching
our progress or that there would be charges laid. Instead, the action
went off without a hitch. Thanks to some incredible 40-foot (12.2
m)-wide banners made by local artist and abolitionist Jenna Reid, we
held the intersections for about an hour — allowing the paint to dry in
the hot sun.

Our mural offering was the start of an action-packed day with marches
and rallies in the name of Juneteenth[^18Syrus_1]. It was documented with drone
footage and photos and remained in situ untouched for several weeks
following its creation. I even had an anonymous inquiry from a friend
working at the city asking if the paint was water based. If so, they
wanted to leave the mural. They had been trying to get the city to agree
to paint a Black Lives Matter (BLM) mural after similar large-scale
BLM-focused murals had been created in Washington and across the USA.

In the weeks following our mural creation, a sister mural was created by
community members in Kensington Market — on August Street — proclaiming
loudly and in bold colors that ‘Black Lives Matter’. In the public
sphere, this message was being taken up by organizations all over Turtle
Island (as referred to by many Indigenous communities in North America).
On what came to be known as Black Out Tuesday, organizations and
galleries blacked out their social media profiles and made solidarity
statements about Black lives. Black artists and activists were charged
with Instagram takeovers and demonstrative actions that made the
organizations look good — even throwing some work towards Black folks
often shut out of the arts and these organizations.

We entered July planning, thinking about how to address the monuments to
slavery and colonialism spread across our city and province. The largest
of these monuments was the policing and prison system, which grew
directly out of slave labor camps and slavery. We met in parks to avoid
surveillance and talked through possibilities. We decided to do an art
project beautifying and addressing three monuments in the city:

-   the statue of known racist, slaver, anti-Indigenous first prime
    minister of Canada, John A. McDonald;

-   the statue of racist and architect of the residential school system
    in Canada Egerton Ryerson, whose system of violence resulted in
    thousands of deaths and millions displaced, and was exported and
    used to create the apartheid system in South Africa- affecting
    millions of Black people; and,

-   the statue of King Edward IV, a colonial statue taken down in India
    during a decolonial process, but purchased through private interest
    and brought to Tkaronto and installed in Queens Park.

I am hesitant to discuss the actions in detail due to the safety of the
activists in my community, but suffice to say Ryerson was beautified
with pink paint. I have memories of the big splash of pink leaving the
buckets, pausing in mid-air and landing on his racist face, dripping
down his form. Thinking back to that morning of the paint splashing
action, I remember being afraid and worried, because I did not know how
it would go. I remembered that I felt similar painting the street and
that we were fine to continue without disruption. However, this action
did not turn out the same. Despite the few victories on that day, we had
arrests and police violence.

The action started beautifully. My memories are like snippets; fragments
fracture from a day of traumatic events. Colorful beautification with
banners tied onto the base of the statues reading ‘TEAR DOWN MONUMENTS
TO SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM’ in pink and neon green. Spray-painted
stencils reading ‘abolish the police’ and ‘end white supremacy’ were
scrawled on the sidewalks and across the statue’s base. There was a
march behind a big pink banner — a swath of pink fabric body proclaiming
our presence — from one site to the next. There was chanting and hope in
our voices. I remember us arriving at John A. McDonald and a similar
action happening; banners tied and paint landed.

Our final site was the statue in the park — an area where we could be
cornered. In mid-action at this site, the police surrounded us. They
stopped the activists near the van with the paint, detained and arrested
three attendees at the protest. We all scattered. A BLM leader on the
megaphone encouraged people to disperse and disappear quickly.

I took off down the street and was chased by cops on foot and on
bicycles. I got away in ways I won’t repeat because I may need these
strategies again in the future. It took three hours for the cops to
drive the arrestees from Queens Park down to 52 division, six blocks
away. They drove them around, handcuffed in the back of separate police
cars in hot temperatures with windows closed, no air conditioning, and
no access to washrooms.

The activists present at the action did a huge call out and got a couple
of hundred people down to the exterior of 52 division and began a vigil
until we could get our people out. We had food donations and supplies
dropped off. People began making signs, covering the police station
signage and the windows at the front of the station. As the day wore on
and we had no knowledge of how long it would take to get our people out
we called for a 6pm rally. At 6pm, we had drummers and guest speakers
talk about justice and prisons and policing and the racist monuments and
more. I was shaking with grief. I was full of rage watching the smug
police officers watching us and our rally at their stationed posts at
the door. I was scared for my comrades who were inside and in danger. I
knew what I had to say — something bubbling up — a mixture of all of
these emotions at once. I got on the microphone and said this:

> Defund, Disarm, Dismantle, Abolish! We are winning — we have already
> won. That’s why they are so afraid of the defund movement. The
> movement to defund and abolish the police is a global movement. People
> are screaming it from their homes, painting it on statues and on the
> streets in such vibrant and bright colors that you can see it from
> space. They’re holding our comrades in there. These people are our
> beloveds. They have put their lives on the line in support of Black
> lives, in support of Black freedom. They have joined with activists
> saying ‘no more’ to statues of colonialism and white supremacy \[…\]
> Our people are in there. They are holding a Mad[^18Syrus_2] woman in there —
> they’re denying her access to her medications. They’re denying her
> access to a doctor. We know what the police do. We must have her free
> tonight! She will be coming home with us tonight. The police and

> ENOUGH! We say disarm the police, we say dismantle the police, we say
> abolish the police! They will not take another Black person! They will
> not take another Mad person. We will not let them. The days are over

I felt relief speaking these words, and hope, more and more hope as they
resonated throughout the crowd and people started clapping and chanting
back, a call and response.

Others gave speeches like mine — some people sang and chanted. Local DJs
came down and set up a dance party in front of the cop shop. We cheered
and yelled and rallied. And while we did, they slowly and quietly moved
the activists from 52 division to other police stations across the city
— three different sites.

It was 3am before we got word through the legal team that they were
being released and we made plans to gather them. Everyone cheered and
celebrated their release. We packed up and left the police station.

Shortly after, the police started casing my block. I live on a small
street with two buildings on it and there is no need for anyone to drive
down the street unless you live there. However, in the days following
the arrests, the police were everywhere on my tiny street. My neighbors
were worried — why were there police everywhere? They held a town hall
meeting for the building. Together, we crafted a no police rule for the
building to provide safety for Black families and racialized and
marginalized folks living in the building. Indeed, there were so many in
our building who were rightly freaked out by the cops being everywhere
and trying to get into our building from time to time.

It was decided that the best decision was to get me out of the city for
a while, so under the cover of night I got in an Uber booked by someone
else to a second location, where I switched cars and got in a second
Uber, before finally arriving at my destination. I stayed in the safe
house for about a week, growing more and more anxious about what was
coming. I felt a profound sense of failure. We had done countless
actions — taken over police headquarters for a 15-day sit-in in 2016;
taken over the Special Investigations Unit in 2016, stopping all work
there that day; and other demos throughout the years. We had never had
arrests prior.

Together, our team went over what could have been done differently to
prevent what happened in the future. The three arrestees faced charges
and lived through a year of surveillance and restrictions on their
movement and living before their charges were finally dropped in July
2021.

\_\_\_

It’s now the summer of 2022 and the uprising has quieted down a bit,
though racial injustice continues and Black deaths at the hands of the
police continue too. Most recently, a Black food delivery driver was
shot 90 times by police during a traffic stop, while a week later a
white person who shot up a crowd was taken into custody safely and
carefully with no injury. Black lives are still being targeted by
policing, this monument to slavery and colonialism, this violent
enterprise designed to uphold white supremacy across the nation state.

I am ready for more actions. Based on our study of the ‘failure’ in 2020
and the resulting trauma these arrests caused in our lives and the lives
of the arrestees, I feel both ready for action and unprepared for what
may come. But I am holding onto hope through the words of Assata Shakur
in her 1980 address to the people after her escape from prison:

> Sisters and brothers, the first thing I wanna say is that I love you,
> and the second thing I want to say is that we can win. We will win our
> liberation. And in order to win our liberation we have got to think
> positively. We have got to believe that we can win. And if we don’t
> believe that we can win, we are whipped before we start. We’ve got to
> realize what dangers exist and we’ve got to look at those dangers
> realistically. We can’t afford to have a subjective distorted
> irrational fear. We’ve got to look at the obstacles to our liberation
> coolly and clearly and to develop ways to get rid of those. For us to
> struggle, for us to fight for our liberation, and for our nation.[^18Syrus_3]

We have to believe that winning is possible, and reflecting on the
arrests and the action I wonder if perhaps this is how we avoid future
failures — actions gone wrong, people’s lives affected — by believing we
can do that which has not been done before, and by learning from our
mistakes as we go.

We have to believe that it is possible to upset this violent and wicked
system. How do we get to abolition? To thriving in an abolitionist
community? We get there by believing it’s possible to have safety,
security, and solutions to conflict, crisis, and harm without carceral
violence and punishment. This action was a spark, something that ignited
discussion and led to significant changes. Perhaps the action was not a
complete failure in that several statues have been removed officially
and unofficially since our actions that day. The statue of John A.
McDonald in Montréal was pulled down in a protest in 2020. Satisfyingly,
the statue's head popped off when it hit the ground. Similarly, the
statue of Egerton Ryerson that was splashed was pulled down in an
Indigenous Resurgence protest about residential schools. These protests
marked the discovery of the remains of 215 children on the grounds of
residential ‘schools’ in Northern Turtle Island (this count is now at
over 10,000 remains found). The statue’s head was severed with a skill
saw and put on a spike at 1492 Land Back Lane — a site of Indigenous
resistance in the province of Ontario. The university named after
Egerton Ryerson officially changed its name in 2022 to Toronto
Metropolitan University to address the white supremacy and violence of
its namesake and to distance the university from this figure in history.
Why did it take arrests and brutality towards our people to push people
to see we needed a change? I’ve spent the last two and half years
reflecting on what went wrong that day and what could have gone even
worse had conditions been different.

Change is starting to happen. The arrests drew attention to these
statues and ultimately created an essential dialogue in our community.
The police violence that day with the arrestees proved our point further
about their racism, violence, and ableism. More and more people got
turned on to the problems of policing, the violence of the system, and
the attack on the right to peaceful protest. Still, this experience
rings alarm bells about the right to protest being dismantled and under
attack and the criminalization of dissent is on the rise. This is
happening all while previously gained rights and justice successes are
at risk or taken away. We have more and more to protest, and less and
less of a right to do so. Change needs to be won, and from this
reflection from the front lines I’m offering that we have a lot to learn
about losses, as we strive for Assata Shakur’s ‘winning’ and for Black
justice. We are still on the front lines, pushing for change and for
justice and moving steadily towards a Black affirming Afro Future — a
speculative imagining made real through our change-making actions today.

## Conclusion

We started with artists, and we end with artists.

Much happened in the days and weeks following the arrests, and even more
in the years following. Artists, many of whom joined us in painting the
street on Juneteenth, wrote an open letter calling for charges to be
dropped and garnered almost 3000 signatures in two weeks. People who
heard activist Ravyn Wngz’s speech at the press conference following the
arrests were moved and politicized. Her speech was shared almost a
million times. Will this influence more people to consider the monuments
to slavery and colonialism and to consider abolition? Time will tell.

We continue to scream from every rooftop ‘Defund, Disarm, Dismantle,
Abolish!’ until we are all free. Until we have all won, as Assata
encouraged. Until we all have self-determination. And until all of the
monuments to slavery and colonialism have been torn down.
